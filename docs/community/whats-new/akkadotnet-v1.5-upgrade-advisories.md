## Upgrading to Akka.NET v1.5.15

Akka.NET v1.5.15 introduces several major changes:

* [Introducing `Akka.Analyzers` - Roslyn Analysis for Akka.NET](xref:akka-analyzers)
* [Akka.Cluster.Sharding: perf optimize message extraction, automate `StartEntity` and `ShardEnvelope` handling](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6863)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: Make `ClusterClient` messages be serialized using `ClusterClientMessageSerializer`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7032)

### Akka.Analyzers

The core Akka NuGet package now references [Akka.Analyzers](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.analyzers), a new set of Roslyn Code Analysis and Code Fix Providers that we distribute via NuGet. You can [see the full set of supported Akka.Analyzers rules here](xref:akka-analyzers).

### Akka.Cluster.Sharding Changes

In [#6863](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6863) we made some major changes to the Akka.Cluster.Sharding API aimed at helping improve Cluster.Sharding's performance _and_ ease of use. However, these changes _may require some effort on the part of the end user_ in order to take full advantage:

* [`ExtractEntityId`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ExtractEntityId) and [`ExtractShardId`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ExtractShardId) have been deprecated as they _fundamentally can't be extended and can't benefit from the performance improvements introduced into Akka.NET v1.5.15_. It is **imperative** that you migrate to using the [`HashCodeMessageExtractor`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.HashCodeMessageExtractor) instead.
* You no longer need to handle [`ShardRegion.StartEntity`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion.StartEntity) or [`ShardingEnvelope`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardingEnvelope) inside your `IMessageExtractor` implementations, and in fact [`AK2001`](xref:AK2001) (part of Akka.Analyzers) will automatically detect this and remove those handlers for you. Akka.NET automatically handles these two message types internally now.

### ClusterClient Serialization Changes

In [#7032](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7032) we solved a long-standing serialization problem with the [`ClusterClient`](xref:Akka.Cluster.Tools.Client.ClusterClient) where  `Send`, `SendToAll`, and `Publish` were not handled by the correct internal serializer. This has been fixed by default in Akka.NET v1.5.15, but this can potentially cause wire compatibility problems during upgrades - therefore we have introduced a configuration setting to toggle this:

```hocon
# re-enable legacy serialization
akka.cluster.client.use-legacy-serialization = on
```

That setting is currently set to `on` by default, so v1.5.15 will still behave like previous versions of Akka.NET. However, if you have been affected by serialization issues with the `ClusterClient` (such as [#6803](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/6803)) you should toggle this setting to `off`.

## Upgrading to Akka.NET v1.5.2

Akka.NET v1.5.2 introduces two important behavioral changes:

* [Akka.Persistence: need to remove hard-coded Newtonsoft.Json `object` serializer](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/6389)
* [Akka.Cluster: enable `keep-majority` as default Split Brain Resolver](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6628)

We meant to include both of these changes in Akka.NET v1.5.0 but simply ran out of time before making them into that release.

### Akka.Persistence Changes

The impact of [Akka.Persistence: need to remove hard-coded Newtonsoft.Json `object` serializer](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/6389) is pretty minor: all versions of Akka.NET prior to 1.5.2 used Newtonsoft.Json as the `object` serializer for Akka.Persistence regardless of whether or not you [used a custom `object` serializer, such as Hyperion](xref:serialization#complex-object-serialization-using-hyperion).

Going forward your user-defined `object` serialization binding will now be respected by Akka.Persistence. Any old data previously saved using Newtonsoft.Json will continue to be recovered automatically by Newtonsoft.Json - it's only the serialization of new objects inserted after upgrading to v1.5.2 that will be affected.

If you _never changed your `object`_ serializer (most users don't) then this change doesn't affect you.

### Akka.Cluster Split Brain Resolver Changes

As of Akka.NET v1.5.2 we've now enabled the `keep-majority` [Split Brain Resolver](xref:split-brain-resolver) by default.

If you were already running with a custom SBR enabled, this change won't affect you.

If you weren't running with an SBR enabled, you should read the [Akka.Cluster Split Brain Resolver documentation](xref:split-brain-resolver).

Also worth noting: we've deprecated the `akka.cluster.auto-down-unreachable-after` setting as it's always been a poor and shoddy way to manage network partitions inside Akka.Cluster. If you have that setting enabled you'll see the following warning appear:

```shell
The `auto-down-unreachable-after` feature has been deprecated as of Akka.NET v1.5.2 and will be removed in a future version of Akka.NET.
The `keep-majority` split brain resolver will be used instead. See https://getakka.net/articles/cluster/split-brain-resolver.html for more details.
```

#### Disabling the Default Downing Provider

To disable the default Akka.Cluster downing provider, simply configure the following in your HOCON:

```hocon
akka.cluster.downing-provider-class = ""
```

This will disable the split brain resolver / downing provider functionality altogether in Akka.NET. This was the default behavior for Akka.Cluster as of Akka.NET v1.5.1 and earlier.

## Upgrading From Akka.NET v1.4 to v1.5

But first: review this document!

### Akka.Cluster.Sharding State Storage

One of the most significant upgrades we've made in Akka.NET v1.5 is a complete rewrite of Akka.Cluster.Sharding's state storage system.

> [!NOTE]
> You can watch [our discussion of this Akka.Cluster.Sharding upgrade during our September, 2022 Akka.NET Community Standup for more details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTBgxeHf91M&t=359s).

In Akka.NET v1.5 we've split Akka.Cluster.Sharding's `state-store-mode` into two parts:

* CoordinatorStore (`akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode`) and
* ShardStore (`akka.cluster.sharding.remember-entities-store`.)

Which can use different persistence modes configured via `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode` & `akka.cluster.sharding.remember-entities-store`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The goal behind this split was to remove the `ShardCoordinator` as a single point of bottleneck during `remember-entities=on` recovery - in Akka.NET v1.4 all remember-entity state is concentrated in the journal of the `PersistentShardCoordinator` or the CRDT used by the `DDataCoordinator`. In v1.5 the responsibility for remembering entities has been pushed to the `Shard` actors themselves, which allows for remembered-entities to be recovered in parallel for all shards.

Possible combinations:

state-store-mode | remember-entities-store | CoordinatorStore mode | ShardStore mode
------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------
persistence (default) | - (ignored) | persistence | persistence
ddata | ddata | ddata | ddata
ddata | eventsourced (new) | ddata | persistence

There should be no breaking changes from user perspective. Only some internal messages/objects were moved. There should be no change in the `PersistentId` behavior and default persistent configuration (`akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode`)

This change is designed to speed up the performance of Akka.Cluster.Sharding coordinator recovery by moving `remember-entities` recovery into separate actors - this also solves major performance problems with the `ddata` recovery mode overall.

The recommended settings for maximum ease-of-use for Akka.Cluster.Sharding in new applications going forward will be:

```hocon
akka.cluster.sharding{
  state-store-mode = ddata
  remember-entities-store = eventsourced
}
```

However, for the sake of backwards compatibility the Akka.Cluster.Sharding defaults have been left as-is:

```hocon
akka.cluster.sharding{
  state-store-mode = persistence
  # remember-entities-store (not set - also uses legacy Akka.Persistence)
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> `state-store-mode=persistence` will be deprecated and `state-store-mode=ddata` will eventually be made the default. Make plans to migrate off of persistence _urgently_.

#### Migrating to DData From Akka.Persistence with Remember Entities

This section applies to users who are using `remember-entities=on` and want to migrate to using the low-latency event-sourced based storage. All other users should just migrate to `state-store-mode=ddata`.

Switching over to using `remember-entities-store = eventsourced` will cause an initial migration of data from the `ShardCoordinator`'s journal into separate event journals going forward.

Upgrading to Akka.NET v1.5 will **cause an irreversible migration of Akka.Cluster.Sharding data** for users who were previously running `akka.cluster.state-store-mode=persistence`, so follow the steps below carefully:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This migration is intended to be performed via upgrading Akka.NET to v1.5 and applying the recommended configuration changes below - **it will require a full restart of your cluster any time you change the `state-store-mode` setting**.

Update your Akka.Cluster.Sharding HOCON to look like the following (adjust as necessary for your custom settings):

```hocon
akka.cluster.sharding {
    remember-entities = on
    remember-entities-store = eventsourced
    state-store-mode = ddata

    # fail if upgrade doesn't succeed
    fail-on-invalid-entity-state-transition = on
}

 akka.persistence.journal.{your-journal-implementation} {
    event-adapters {
        coordinator-migration = ""Akka.Cluster.Sharding.OldCoordinatorStateMigrationEventAdapter, Akka.Cluster.Sharding""
    }

    event-adapter-bindings {
        ""Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardCoordinator+IDomainEvent, Akka.Cluster.Sharding"" = coordinator-migration
    }
}
```

#### Migrating to DData From Akka.Persistence without Remember Entities

If you're migrating from `state-store-mode=persistence` to `state-store-mode=ddata` and don't use `remember-entities=on`, then all you have to configure is the following:

```hocon
akka.cluster.sharding {
    state-store-mode = ddata
}

```

#### Executing Migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section only applies to users migrating from `state-store-mode=persistence` to `state-store-mode=ddata`. For all other users there is no need to plan a special deployment - the transition to Akka.NET v1.5 sharding will be seamless. It's only the changing of `state-store-mode` settings that requires a restart of the cluster.

To deploy this upgrade:

1. Take your cluster offline and
2. Roll out the changes with the new version of Akka.NET installed and these HOCON changes.

It should less than 10 seconds to fully migrate over to the new format and the Akka.Cluster.Sharding system will continue to start normally while it takes place.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't run Akka.Cluster.Sharding with `remember-entities=on` normally then _there is no need to turn it on here_.

With these HOCON settings in-place the following will happen:

1. The old `PersitentShardCoordinator` state will be broken up - `remember-entities=on` data will be distributed to each of the `PersistentShard` actors, who will now use the new `remember-entities-store = "eventsourced"` setting going forward;
2. Old `Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardCoordinator+IDomainEvent` will be upgraded to a new storage format via the `coordinator-migration` Akka.Persistence event adapter; and
3. No more data will be persisted by the `ShardCoordinator` - instead it will all be replicated on the fly by DData, which is vastly preferable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This migration is irreversible once completed.

If you run into any trouble upgrading, [please file an issue with Akka.NET](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/new/choose).

### Breaking Logging Changes

In v1.5, we've re-engineering the `ILoggingAdapter` construct to be more extensible and performant. Unfortunately this necessitate some breaking changes that will affect end-user code - but the remedy for those changes is trivial.

After installing the v1.5 NuGet packages into your applications or libraries, you will need to add the following to all of your source files where you previously made calls to the `ILoggingAdapter`:

```csharp
using Akka.Event;
```

That `using` statement will pull in the extension methods that match all of the v1.4 API `ILoggingAdapter` signatures in v1.5.

_Even better_ - if you can take advantage of [`global using` statements in C#10](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/11/18/global-usings-in-csharp-10/), then this is a one-liner as either the MSBuild or project level:

In `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Akka" />
        <Using Include="Akka.Event" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Note, in order to log more than 6 parameters you need to explicitly create ```object[]``` and pass your arguments into corresponding method. It was done in order to eliminate large numbers of accidental ```object[]``` allocations that were created implicitly through the params keyword AND to eliminate the large amount of boxing that occurred whenever value types (struct) were logged:

```csharp
var @params = new[]{arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6, arg7};
loggingAdapter.Log(format, @params);
```
