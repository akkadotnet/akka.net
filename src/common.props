    <PackageReleaseNotes>Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**
The largest changes featured in Akka.NET v1.3.3 are the introduction of [Splint brain resolvers](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/split-brain-resolver.html) and `WeaklyUp` members in Akka.Cluster.
Akka.Cluster Split Brain Resolvers**
Split brain resolvers are specialized [`IDowningProvider`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.IDowningProvider.html) implementations that give Akka.Cluster users the ability to automatically down `Unreachable` cluster nodes in accordance with well-defined partition resolution strategies, namely:
Static quorums;
Keep majority;
Keep oldest; and
Keep-referee.
You can learn more about why you may want to use these and which strategy is right for you by reading our [Splint brain resolver documentation](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/split-brain-resolver.html).
Akka.Cluster `WeaklyUp` Members**
One common problem that occurs in Akka.Cluster is that once a current member of the cluster becomes `Unreachable`, the leader of the cluster isn't able to allow any new members of the cluster to join until that `Unreachable` member becomes `Reachable` again or is removed from the cluster via a [`Cluster.Down` command](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Cluster.html#Akka_Cluster_Cluster_Down_Akka_Actor_Address_).
Beginning in Akka.NET 1.3.3, you can allow nodes to still join and participate in the cluster even while other member nodes are unreachable by opting into the `WeaklyUp` status for members. You can do this by setting the following in your HOCON configuration beginning in Akka.NET v1.3.3:
```
akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members = on
```
This will allow nodes who have joined the cluster when at least one other member was unreachable to become functioning cluster members with a status of `WeaklyUp`. If the unreachable members of the cluster are downed or become reachable again, all `WeaklyUp` nodes will be upgraded to the usual `Up` status for available cluster members.
Akka.Cluster.Sharding and Akka.Cluster.DistributedData Integration**
A new experimental feature we've added in Akka.NET v1.3.3 is the ability to fully decouple [Akka.Cluster.Sharding](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html) from Akka.Persistence and instead run it on top of [Akka.Cluster.DistributedData, our library for creating eventually consistent replicated data structures on top of Akka.Cluster](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/distributed-data.html).
Beginning in Akka.NET 1.3.3, you can set the following HOCON configuration option to have the `ShardingCoordinator` replicate its shard placement state using DData instead of persisting it to storage via Akka.Persistence:
```
akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode = ddata
```
This setting only affects how Akka.Cluster.Sharding's internal state is managed. If you're using Akka.Persistence with your own entity actors inside Akka.Cluster.Sharding, this change will have no impact on them.
