# ASP.NET Core

## The Bridge

When deploying Akka.NET in ASP.NET Core, one major concern is how to expose `actor` in an ASP.NET Core controllers. We will design an `interface` for this!

## Akka.NET with `IHostedService`

With the `IActorBridge` created, next is to host Akka.NET with `IHostedService` which will also implement the `IActorBridge`:

## Interaction Between Controllers and Akka.NET

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../src/examples/AspNetCore/Akka.AspNetCore/Controllers/AkkaController.cs?name=akka-aspnet-core-controllers)]

### Wire up Akka.NET and ASP.NET Core

We need to replace the default `IHostedService` with `AkkaService` and also inject `IActorBridge`.
