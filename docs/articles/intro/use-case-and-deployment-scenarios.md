# Use-case and Deployment Scenarios

## Console Application

```csharp
PM> install-package Akka
PM> install-package Akka.Remote
```

```csharp
using Akka;
using Akka.Actor;
using Akka.Configuration;

namespace Foo.Bar
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //configure remoting for localhost:8081
            var fluentConfig = FluentConfig.Begin()
                .StartRemotingOn("localhost", 8081)
                .Build();

            using (var system = ActorSystem.Create("my-actor-server", fluentConfig))
            {
                //start two services
                var service1= system.ActorOf<Service1>("service1");
                var service2 = system.ActorOf<Service2>("service2");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## ASP.NET

### Creating the Akka.NET resources

Hosting inside an ASP.NET application is easy. The Global.asax would be the designated place to start.

```csharp
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    protected static ActorSystem ActorSystem;
    //here you would store your toplevel actor-refs
    protected static IActorRef MyActor;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        //your mvc config. Does not really matter if you initialise
        //your actor system before or after

        ActorSystem = ActorSystem.Create("app");
        //here you would register your toplevel actors
        MyActor = ActorSystem.ActorOf<MyActor>();
    }
}
```

As you can see the main point here is keeping a static reference to your `ActorSystem` . This ensures it won't be accidentally garbage collected and gets disposed and created with the start and stop events of your web application. 

> [!WARNING]
> Although hosting inside an ASP.NET Application is easy. A **word of caution**: When you are hosting inside of `IIS` the applicationpool your app lives in could be stopped and started at the whim of `IIS`. This in turn means your `ActorSystem` could be stopped at any given time.

Typically you use a very lightweight `ActorSystem` inside ASP.NET applications, and offload heavy-duty work to a seperate Windows Service via Akka.Remote / Akka.Cluster

### Interaction between Controllers and Akka.NET
In the sample below, we use an Web API Controller:
```csharp
public class SomeController  : ApiController
{
      //expose your endpoint as async
      public async Task<SomeResult> Post(SomeRequest someRequest)
      {
           //send a message based on your incoming arguments to one of the actors you created earlier
           //and await the result by sending the message to `Ask`
           var result = await MvcApplication.MyActor.Ask<SomeResult>(new SomeMessage(someRequest.SomeArg1,someRequest.SomeArg2));
           return result;
      }
}
```

## Windows Service

For windows service deployment its recommended to use
[TopShelf](http://topshelf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
to build your Windows Services. It radically simplifies hosting Windows Services.

The quickest way to get started with TopShelf is by creating a Console
Application. Which would look like this:

#### Program.cs
```csharp
using Akka.Actor;
using Topshelf;
```
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        HostFactory.Run(x =>
        {
            x.Service<MyActorService>(s =>
            {
                s.ConstructUsing(n => new MyActorService());
                s.WhenStarted(service => service.Start());
                s.WhenStopped(service => service.Stop());
                //continue and restart directives are also available
            });

            x.RunAsLocalSystem();
            x.UseAssemblyInfoForServiceInfo();
        });
    }
}

/// <summary>
/// This class acts as an interface between your application and TopShelf
/// </summary>
public class MyActorService
{
    private ActorSystem mySystem;

    public void Start()
    {
        //this is where you setup your actor system and other things
        mySystem = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem");
    }

    public async void Stop()
    {
        //this is where you stop your actor system
        await mySystem.Terminate();
    }
}
```

The above example is the simplest way imaginable. However there are also other
styles of integration with TopShelf that give you more control.

Installing with Topshelf is as easy as calling `myConsoleApp.exe install` on
the command line.

For all the options and settings check out their
[docs](http://topshelf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

## Azure PaaS Worker Role

The following sample assumes that you have created a new Azure Paas Cloud Service that contains a single
empty Worker Role. The Cloud Service project templates are added to Visual Studio by installing the 
[Azure .Net SDK](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/downloads/).

The Worker Role implementation can be tested locally using the Azure Compute Emulator before deploying to the cloud. The MSDN Azure article ["Using Emulator Express to Run and Debug a Cloud Service Locally"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn339018.aspx) describes this in more detail.

The Azure PaaS Worker Role implementation is very similar to the [Akka.Net Windows Service Sample](use-case-and-deployment-scenarios.md#windows-service). 
The quickest way to get started with Akka.Net is to create a simple Worker Role which invokes the top-level
user-actor in the RunAsync() method, as follows:

#### WorkerRole.cs
```csharp
using Akka.Actor;
```
```csharp
namespace MyActorWorkerRole
{
    public class WorkerRole : RoleEntryPoint
    {
        private readonly CancellationTokenSource cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
        private readonly ManualResetEvent runCompleteEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false);

        private ActorSystem _actorSystem;

        public override bool OnStart()
        {
            // Setup the Actor System
            _actorSystem = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem");

            return (base.OnStart());
        }

        public override void OnStop()
        {
            this.cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();
            this.runCompleteEvent.WaitOne();

            // Shutdown the Actor System
            _actorSystem.Shutdown();

            base.OnStop();
        }

        public override void Run()
        {
            try
            {
                this.RunAsync(this.cancellationTokenSource.Token).Wait();
            }
            finally
            {
                this.runCompleteEvent.Set();
            }
        }

        private async Task RunAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // Create an instance to the top-level user Actor
            var workerRoleActor = _actorSystem.ActorOf<WorkerRoleActor>("WorkerRole");

            // Send a message to the Actor
            workerRoleActor.Tell(new WorkerRoleMessage("Hello World!"));

            while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                await Task.Delay(1000);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
