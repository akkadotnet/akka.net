#### 1.5.45 July 7th, 2025 ####

Akka.NET v1.5.45 is a minor patch containing bug fixes for Core Akka and Akka.Cluster.Sharding plugin.

* [Core: Code modernization, use deconstructor for variable swapping](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7658)
* [Sharding: Fix unclean `ShardingConsumerControllerImpl` shutdown](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7714)
* [Core: Convert `Failure` to `Exception` for `Ask<object>`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7286)

* [Sharding: Make remembered entities honor supervision strategy decisions](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7720)

**Supervision Strategy For Sharding Remembered Entities**

* We've added a `SupervisorStrategy` property to `ClusterShardingSettings`. You can use any type of `SupervisionStrategy`, but it is recommended that you inherit `ShardSupervisionStrategy` if you're making your own custom supervision strategy.
* Remembered shard entities will now honor `SupervisionStrategy` decisions and stops remembered entities if the `SupervisionStrategy.Decider` returned a `Directive.Stop` or if there is a maximum restart retry limitation.

**New Akka.Analyzer Rules**

We've added three new Akka.Analyzer rules, AK2003, AK2004, and AK2005. All of them addresses the same Akka anti-pattern where a `void async` delegate is being passed into the `ReceiveActor.Receive<T>()` (AK2003), `IDslActor.Receive<T>()` (AK2004), and `ReceivePersistentActor.Command<T>()` (AK2005) message handlers.

Here are the documentation for each new rules:
* [AK2003 documentation](https://getakka.net/articles/debugging/rules/AK2003.html)
* [AK2004 documentation](https://getakka.net/articles/debugging/rules/AK2004.html)
* [AK2005 documentation](https://getakka.net/articles/debugging/rules/AK2005.html)
