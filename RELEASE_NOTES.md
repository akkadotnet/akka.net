#### 1.4.33 February 14 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.4.33 is a minor release that contains some bug fixes. Most of the changes have been aimed at improving our web documentation and code cleanup to modernize some of our code. The most important bug fix is the actor Props memory leak when actors are cached inside Akka.Remote. 

* [Akka: Fix memory leak bug within actor Props](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5556)
* [Akka: Fix ChannelExecutor configuration backward compatibility bug](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5568)
* [Akka.TestKit: Fix ExpectAsync detached Task bug](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5538)

#### 1.4.32 January 19 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.4.32 is a minor release that contains some API improvements. Most of the changes have been aimed at improving our web documentation and code cleanup to modernize some of our code. One big improvement in this version release is the Hyperion serialization update. 

Hyperion 0.12.0 introduces a new deserialization security mechanism to allow users to selectively filter allowed types during deserialization to prevent deserialization of untrusted data described [here](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html). This new feature is exposed in Akka.NET in HOCON through the new [`akka.actor.serialization-settings.hyperion.allowed-types`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/contrib/serializers/Akka.Serialization.Hyperion/reference.conf#L33-L35) settings or programmatically through the new `WithTypeFilter` method in the `HyperionSerializerSetup` class.

The simplest way to programmatically describe the type filter is to use the convenience class `TypeFilterBuilder`:

```c#
var typeFilter = TypeFilterBuilder.Create()
    .Include<AllowedClassA>()
    .Include<AllowedClassB>()
    .Build();
var setup = HyperionSerializerSetup.Default
    .WithTypeFilter(typeFilter);
```

You can also create your own implementation of `ITypeFilter` and pass an instance of it into the `WithTypeFilter` method.

For complete documentation, please read the Hyperion [readme on filtering types for secure deserialization.](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Hyperion#whitelisting-types-on-deserialization)

* [Akka.Streams: Added Flow.LazyInitAsync and Sink.LazyInitSink to replace Sink.LazyInit](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5476)
* [Akka.Serialization.Hyperion: Implement the new ITypeFilter security feature](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5510)

#### 1.4.31 December 20 2021 ####
Akka.NET v1.4.31 is a minor release that contains some bug fixes.

Akka.NET v1.4.30 contained a breaking change that broke binary compatibility with all Akka.DI plugins.
Even though those plugins are deprecated that change is not compatible with our SemVer standards 
and needed to be reverted. We regret the error.

Bug fixes:
* [Akka: Reverted Props code refactor](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5454)

#### 1.4.28 November 10 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.28 is a minor release that contains some enhancements for Akka.Streams and some bug fixes.

**New Akka.Streams Stages**
Akka.NET v1.4.28 includes two new Akka.Streams stages:

* [`Source.Never`](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/builtinstages.html#never) - a utility stage that never emits any elements, never completes, and never fails. Designed primarily for unit testing.
* [`Flow.WireTap`](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/builtinstages.html#wiretap) - the `WireTap` stage attaches a given `Sink` to a `Flow` without affecting any of the upstream or downstream elements. This stage is designed for performance monitoring and instrumentation of Akka.Streams graphs.

In addition to these, here are some other changes introduced Akka.NET v1.4.28:

* [Akka.Streams: `Source` that flattens a `Task` source and keeps the materialized value](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5338)
* [Akka.Streams: made `GraphStageLogic.LogSource` virtual and change default `StageLogic` `LogSource`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5360)
* [Akka.IO: `UdpListener` Responds IPv6 Bound message with IPv4 Bind message](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5344)
* [Akka.MultiNodeTestRunner: now runs on Linux and as a `dotnet test` package](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.MultiNodeTestRunner/releases/tag/1.0.0) - we will keep you posted on this, as we're still working on getting Rider / VS Code / Visual Studio debugger-attached support to work correctly.
* [Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common: Cancel `DBCommand` after finish reading events by PersistenceId ](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5311) - *massive* performance fix for Akka.Persistence with many log entries on SQL-based journals.
* [Akka.Actor: `DefaultResizer` does not reisize when `ReceiveAsync` is used](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5327)

#### 1.4.27 October 11 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.27 is a small release that contains some _major_ performance improvements for Akka.Remote.

**Performance Fixes**
In [RemoteActorRefProvider address paring, caching and resolving improvements](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5273) Akka.NET contributor @Zetanova introduced some major changes that make the entire `ActorPath` class much more reusable and more parse-efficient.

Our last major round of Akka.NET performance improvements in Akka.NET v1.4.25 produced the following:

```
OSVersion:                         Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0
ProcessorCount:                    16
ClockSpeed:                        0 MHZ
Actor Count:                       32
Messages sent/received per client: 200000  (2e5)
Is Server GC:                      True
Thread count:                      111

Num clients, Total [msg], Msgs/sec, Total [ms]
         1,  200000,    130634,    1531.54
         5, 1000000,    246975,    4049.20
        10, 2000000,    244499,    8180.16
        15, 3000000,    244978,   12246.39
        20, 4000000,    245159,   16316.37
        25, 5000000,    243333,   20548.09
        30, 6000000,    241644,   24830.55
```

In Akka.NET v1.4.27 those numbers now look like:

```
OSVersion:                         Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.
ProcessorCount:                    16                            
ClockSpeed:                        0 MHZ                         
Actor Count:                       32                            
Messages sent/received per client: 200000  (2e5)                 
Is Server GC:                      True                          
Thread count:                      111                           
                                                                 
Num clients, Total [msg], Msgs/sec, Total [ms]                   
         1,  200000,    105043,    1904.29                       
         5, 1000000,    255494,    3914.73                       
        10, 2000000,    291843,    6853.30                       
        15, 3000000,    291291,   10299.75                       
        20, 4000000,    286513,   13961.68                       
        25, 5000000,    292569,   17090.64                       
        30, 6000000,    281492,   21315.35
```

To put these numbers in comparison, here's what Akka.NET's performance looked like as of v1.4.0:

```
Num clients (actors)    Total [msg] Msgs/sec    Total [ms]
1   200000  69736   2868.60
5   1000000 141243  7080.98
10  2000000 136771  14623.27
15  3000000 38190   78556.49
20  4000000 32401   123454.60
25  5000000 33341   149967.08
30  6000000 126093  47584.92
```


We've made Akka.Remote consistently faster, more predictable, and reduced total memory consumption significantly in the process.

#### 1.4.26 September 28 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.26 is a very small release that addresses one wire format regression introduced in Akka.NET v1.4.20.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**
* [Akka.Remote / Akka.Persistence: PrimitiveSerializers manifest backwards compatibility problem](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5279) - this could cause regressions when upgrading to Akka.NET v1.4.20 and later. We have resolved this issue in Akka.NET v1.4.26. [Please see our Akka.NET v1.4.26 upgrade advisory for details](https://getakka.net/community/whats-new/akkadotnet-v1.4-upgrade-advisories.html#upgrading-to-akkanet-v1426-from-older-versions).
* [Akka.DistributedData.LightningDb: Revert #5180, switching back to original LightningDB packages](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5286)

#### 1.4.25 September 08 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.25 includes some _significant_ performance improvements for Akka.Remote and a number of important bug fixes and improvements.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**
* [Akka.IO.Tcp: connecting to an unreachable DnsEndpoint never times out](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5154)
* [Akka.Actor: need to enforce `stdout-loglevel = off` all the way through ActorSystem lifecycle](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5246)
* [Akka.Actor: `Ask` should push unhandled answers into deadletter](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5259)
* [Akka.Routing: Make Router.Route` virtual](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5238)
* [Akka.Actor: Improve performance on `IActorRef.Child` API](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5242) - _signficantly_ improves performance of many Akka.NET functions, but includes a public API change on `IActorRef` that is source compatible but not necessarily binary-compatible. `IActorRef GetChild(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<string> name)` is now `IActorRef GetChild(System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<string> name)`. This API is almost never called directly by user code (it's almost always called via the internals of the `ActorSystem` when resolving `ActorSelection`s or remote messages) so this change should be safe.
* [Akka.Actor: `IsNobody` throws NRE](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5213)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: singleton fix cleanup of overdue _removed members](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5229)
* [Akka.DistributedData: ddata exclude `Exiting` members in Read/Write `MajorityPlus`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5227)

**Performance Improvements**
Using our standard `RemotePingPong` benchmark, the difference between v1.4.24 and v1.4.24 is significant:

```

This represents a 24% overall throughput improvement in Akka.Remote across the board. We have additional PRs staged that should get aggregate performance improvements above 40% for Akka.Remote over v1.4.24 but they didn't make it into the Akka.NET v1.4.25 release.

#### 1.4.23 August 09 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**

Akka.NET v1.4.23 is designed to patch an issue that occurs on Linux machines using Akka.Cluster.Sharding with `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode=ddata` and `akka.cluster.sharding.remember-entities=on`: "[System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'lmdb' or one of its dependencies](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5174)"

In [Akka.NET v1.4.21 we added built-in support for Akka.DistributedData.LightningDb](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/1.4.21) for use with the `remember-entities` setting, but we never received any reports about this issue until shortly after v1.4.22 was released. Fundamentally, the problem was that our downstream dependency, Lightning.NET, doesn't include any of the necessary Linux native binaries in their distributions currently. So in the meantime, we've published our own "vendored" distribution of Lightning.NET to NuGet until a new official one is released that includes these binaries.

There are some other small [fixes included in Akka.NET v1.4.23 and you can read about them here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/54).

#### 1.4.22 August 05 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**

Akka.NET v1.4.22 is a fairly large release that includes an assortment of performance and bug fixes.

**Performance Fixes**
Akka.NET v1.4.22 includes a _significant_ performance improvement for `Ask<T>`, which now requires 1 internal `await` operation instead of 3:

**Akka.Cluster.Sharding.RepairTool**
In addition to the work done on Akka.NET itself, we've also created a separate tool for cleaning up any left-over data in the event of an Akka.Cluster.Sharding cluster running with `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode=persistence` was terminated abruptly before it had a chance to cleanup.

We've added documentation to the Akka.NET website that explains how to use this tool here: https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html#cleaning-up-akkapersistence-shard-state

And the tool itself has documentation here: https://github.com/petabridge/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.RepairTool
