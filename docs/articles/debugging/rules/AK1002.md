# AK1002 - Error

You should never await [`Self`](xref:Akka.Actor.ActorBase#Akka_Actor_ActorBase_Self).[`GracefulStop()`](xref:Akka.Actor.GracefulStopSupport#Akka_Actor_GracefulStopSupport_GracefulStop_Akka_Actor_IActorRef_System_TimeSpan_) inside [`ReceiveActor`](xref:Akka.Actor.ReceiveActor) [`ReceiveAsync<T>()`](xref:Akka.Actor.ReceiveActor#Akka_Actor_ReceiveActor_ReceiveAsync__1_System_Func___0_System_Threading_Tasks_Task__System_Predicate___0__) or [`ReceiveAnyAsync()`](xref:Akka.Actor.ReceiveActor#Akka_Actor_ReceiveActor_ReceiveAnyAsync_System_Func_System_Object_System_Threading_Tasks_Task__)

## Cause

Awaiting `Self.GracefulStop()` inside `ReceiveAsync<T>()` or `ReceiveAnyAsync()` will cause a deadlock because the `ReceiveActor` will block and wait inside the message handler for itself to terminate while its `PoisonPill` signal is stuck inside its `MailBox`, waiting to be processed.

An example:

```csharp
using Akka.Actor;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System;

public sealed class MyActor : ReceiveActor
{
   public MyActor()
   {
      ReceiveAsync<string>(async str => {
         await Context.Self.GracefulStop(); // THIS WILL DEADLOCK
      }):
   }
}
```

## Resolution

If you absolutely need to invoke `Self.GracefulStop()` inside `ReceiveAsync<T>()` or `ReceiveAnyAsync()`, make sure that you're using a detached `Task` instead of awaiting for it to complete.

Here's an example below:

```csharp
using Akka.Actor;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System;

public sealed class MyActor : ReceiveActor
{
   public MyActor()
   {
      ReceiveAsync<string>(async str => {
         _ = Context.Self.GracefulStop();
      }):
   }
}
```
