# Headless Service

A “headless” service is one that doesn’t expose a public-facing API or UI of any kind - no HTTP APIs, no gRPC, etc.

Headless services can still communicate with other services via private messaging systems such as Akka.Remote, Kafka, Apache Pulsar, RabbitMQ, and so forth - but they run in the background of most networked applications.
