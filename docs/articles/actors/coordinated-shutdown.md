# Coordinated Shutdown
There's an `ActorSystem` extension called `CoordinatedShutdown` that will stop certain Akka.NET actors / services and execute tasks in a programmable order during shutdown.

The default phases and their orderings are defined in the default HOCON configuration as `akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases`, and they are defined below:

```
phases {

  # The first pre-defined phase that applications can add tasks to.
  # Note that more phases can be be added in the application's
  # configuration by overriding this phase with an additional 
  # depends-on.
  before-service-unbind {
  }

  # Stop accepting new incoming requests in for example HTTP.
  service-unbind {
    depends-on = [before-service-unbind]
  }
  
  # Wait for requests that are in progress to be completed.
  service-requests-done {
    depends-on = [service-unbind]
  }
  
  # Final shutdown of service endpoints.
  service-stop {
    depends-on = [service-requests-done]
  }
  
  # Phase for custom application tasks that are to be run
  # after service shutdown and before cluster shutdown.
  before-cluster-shutdown {
    depends-on = [service-stop]
  }
  
  # Graceful shutdown of the Cluster Sharding regions.
  cluster-sharding-shutdown-region {
    timeout = 10 s
    depends-on = [before-cluster-shutdown]
  }
  
  # Emit the leave command for the node that is shutting down.
  cluster-leave {
    depends-on = [cluster-sharding-shutdown-region]
  }
  
  # Shutdown cluster singletons
  cluster-exiting {
    timeout = 10 s
    depends-on = [cluster-leave]
  }
  
  # Wait until exiting has been completed
  cluster-exiting-done {
    depends-on = [cluster-exiting]
  }
  
  # Shutdown the cluster extension
  cluster-shutdown {
    depends-on = [cluster-exiting-done]
  }
  
  # Phase for custom application tasks that are to be run
  # after cluster shutdown and before ActorSystem termination.
  before-actor-system-terminate {
    depends-on = [cluster-shutdown]
  }
  
  # Last phase. See terminate-actor-system and exit-jvm above.
  # Don't add phases that depends on this phase because the 
  # dispatcher and scheduler of the ActorSystem have been shutdown. 
  actor-system-terminate {
    timeout = 10 s
    depends-on = [before-actor-system-terminate]
  }
}
```

## Custom Phases

As an end-user, you can register tasks to execute during any of these shutdown phases and add additional phases if you wish.

More phases can be added to an application by overriding the HOCON of an existing phase to include additional members in its `phase.depends-on` property. Here's an example where an additional phase might be executing before shutting down the cluster, for instance:

```
akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases.before-cluster-shutdown.depends-on = [service-stop, my-phase]
my-phase{
	timeout = 10s
	recover = on
}
```

For each phase, the following properties can be set:

1. `depends-on` - specifies which other phases have to run successfully first before this phase can begin;
2. `timeout` - specifies how long the tasks in this phase are allowed to run before timing out;
3. `recover` - if set to `off`, if any of the tasks in this phase throw an exception then the `CoordinatedShutdown` will be aborted and no further phases will be run. If set to `on` then any thrown errors are suppressed and the system will continue to execute the `CoordinatedShutdown`.

The default phases are defined in a linear order, but in practice the phases are ordered into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using [Topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

## Registering Tasks to a Phase

For instance, if you're using [Akka.Cluster](../clustering/cluster-overview.md) it's commonplace to register application-specific cleanup tasks during the `cluster-leave` and `cluster-exiting` phases. Here's an example:

```
var coordShutdown = CoordinatedShutdown.Get(myActorSystem);
coordShutdown.AddTask(CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseClusterLeave, "cleanup-my-api", () =>
{
	return _myCustomSocketApi.CloseAsync().ContinueWith(tr => Done.Instance);
});
```

Each shutdown task added to a phase must specify a function that returns a value of type `Task<Done>`. This function will be invoked once the `CoordinatedShutdown.Run()` command is executed and the `Task<Done>` returned by the function will be completed in parallel with all other tasks executing in the given phase. Those tasks may complete in any possible order; `CoordinatedShutdown` doesn't attempt to order the execution of tasks within a single phase. Once all of those tasks have completed OR if the phases timeout has expired, the next phase will begin.

Tasks should be registered as early as possible, preferably at system startup, in order to ensure that all registered tasks are run. If tasks are added after the `CoordinatedShutdown` have begun its run, it's possible that the newly registered tasks will not be executed.

## Running `CoordinatedShutdown` 
There are a few different ways to start the `CoordinatedShutdown` process.

If you wish to execute the `CoordinatedShutdown` yourself, you can simply call `CoordinatedShutdown.Run(CoordinatedShutdown.Reason)`, which takes a [`CoordinatedShutdown.Reason`](/api/Akka.Actor.CoordinatedShutdown.Reason.html) argument will return a `Task<Done>`. 

[!code-csharp[CoordinatedShutdownSpecs.cs](../../examples/DocsExamples/Actors/CoordinatedShutdownSpecs.cs?name=coordinated-shutdown-builtin)]

It's safe to call this method multiple times as the shutdown process will only be run once and will return the same completion task each time. The `Task<Done>` will complete once all phases have run successfully, or a phase with `recover = off` failed.

> It's possible to subclass the `CoordinatedShutdown.Reason` type and pass in a custom implementation which includes custom properties and data. This data is accessible inside the shutdown phases themselves via the [`CoordinatedShutdown.ShutdownReason` property](/api/Akka.Actor.CoordinatedShutdown.html#Akka_Actor_CoordinatedShutdown_ShutdownReason).

### Automatic `ActorSystem` and Process Termination
By default, when the final phase of the `CoordinatedShutdown` executes the calling `ActorSystem` will be terminated. However, the CLR process will still be running even though the `ActorSystem` has been terminated.

If you'd like to automatically terminate the process running your `ActorSystem`, you can set the following HOCON value in your configuration:

```
akka.coordinated-shutdown.exit-clr = on
```

If this setting is enabled (it's disabled by default), you'll be able to shutdown the current running process automatically via an `Environment.Exit(0)` call made during the final phase of the `CoordinatedShutdown`.

### `CoordinatedShutdown` and Akka.Cluster
If you're using Akka.Cluster, the `CoordinatedShutdown` will automatically register tasks for completing the following:

1. Gracefully leaving the cluster;
2. Gracefully handing over / terminating ClusterSingleton and Cluster.Sharding instances; and
3. Terminating the `Cluster` system itself.

By default, this graceful leave action will by triggered whenever the `CoordinatedShutdown.Run(Reason)` method is called. Conversely, calling `Cluster.Leave` on a cluster member will also cause the `CoordinatedShutdown` to run and will terminate the `ActorSystem` once the node has left the cluster.

`CoordinatedShutdown.Run()` will also be executed if a node is removed via `Cluster.Down` (non-graceful exit), but this can be disabled by changing the following Akka.Cluster HOCON setting:

```
akka.cluster.run-coordinated-shutdown-when-down = off 
```

### Invoking `CoordinatedShutdown.Run()` on Process Exit
By default `CoordinatedShutdown.Run()` will be called whenever the current process attempts to exit (using the `AppDomain.ProcessExit` event hook) and this will give the `ActorSystem` and the underlying clustering tools an opportunity to cleanup gracefully before the process finishes exiting.

If you wish to disable this behavior, you can pass in the following HOCON configuration value:

```
akka.coordinated-shutdown.run-by-clr-shutdown-hook = off
```
