# Akka.Cluster Routing
[Akka.Cluster](cluster-overview.md) extends the capabilities of both [`Pool` and `Group`](xref:routers#pools-vs-groups) routers to work across entire clusters of Akka.NET applications, and can automatically add or remove routees as new nodes join and exit the cluster.

![Akka.Cluster clustered routers capabilities overview](/images/cluster-routers.png)

## How Routers Use Cluster Gossip
How the gossip is used depends on the type of the router. Clustered `Pool` routers will automatically [remote-deploy](../remoting/deployment.md) routees onto nodes they discover as a result of changes in cluster membership. `Group` routers will add new `ActorSelectionRoutee`s to their routees list instead.

> [!NOTE]
> this section refers to gossip events, such as `ClusterEvent.MemberUp`, which are [covered here](cluster-extension.md#cluster-gossip-event-types).

Clustered routers subscribe to gossip messages from the `Cluster` object (which [you can also do in a user-defined actor](xref:cluster-extension#subscribing-and-unsubscribing-from-cluster-gossip)), and they use the information they dynamically receive from the cluster to ad or remove routees on the fly.

A `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message will cause the cluster to add a new routee (although this depends on some of the router configuration options) and a `ClusterEvent.MemberRemoved` will cause the clustered router to remove any routees who were on the affected node.

## Cluster Routing Strategies
[All of the routing strategies](xref:routers#routing-strategies) that are available in Akka.NET core are also available in Akka.Cluster - `RoundRobin` and `ConsistentHash` work just as well across the network as they do locally.

## Types of Clustered Routers
### Clustered `Group` Routers
The first type of router we're going to look at at clustered `Group` routers.

![Akka.Cluster group routers in action](/images/akka-cluster-routers.png)

So what's happening in the diagram above? In this setup, we have three distinct nodes:

1. localhost:89, who's already **Up**, and is the node which has a clustered `Group` router running on it;
2. localhost:90, who's **not Up** yet but will be routed to; and
3. localhost:91, who's **not Up** yet and will also be routed to.

We're going to route messages from localhost:89 to all of the actors who live at path `/user/foo` on each of the new nodes who join. So here's the sequence of events that occurs:

1. localhost:90 joins the cluster and a `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message gets generated on each member.
2. `Group` router on localhost:89 receives the `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message;
3. `Group` router adds `akka.tcp://Sys@localhost:90/user/foo` as a routee and begins routing messages to it over the network;
4. localhost:91 joins the cluster and a `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message gets generated on each member.
5. `Group` router on localhost:89 receives the `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message;
6. `Group` router adds `akka.tcp://Sys@localhost:91/user/foo` as a routee and begins routing messages to it over the network.

If either localhost:90 or localhost:91 was removed from the cluster at some point in the future, their routee would be removed from the `Group` router running on localhost:89.

### Clustered `Pool` Routers
Clustered `Pool` routers differ from `Group` routers in that they deploy their routees remotely onto their target nodes, versus routing messages to pre-defined actor paths that may or may not exist on the remote machines.

Here's a `Pool` scenario equivalent to the `Group` one we showed earlier:

![Akka.Cluster pool routers in action](/images/akka-cluster-pool-routers.png)

This is a virtually identical setup as the `Group` router:

1. localhost:89, who's already **Up**, and is the node which has a clustered `Pool` router running on it;
2. localhost:90, who's **not Up** yet but will be deployed onto and routed to; and
3. localhost:91, who's **not Up** yet and will also be deployed onto and routed to.

localhost:89 is going to deploy routees onto localhost:90 and localhost:91 and subsequently route messages to them. Here's how that occurs:

1. localhost:90 joins the cluster and a `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message gets generated on each member.
2. `Pool` router on localhost:89 receives the `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message;
3. `Pool` router REMOTE DEPLOYS `akka.tcp://Sys@localhost:90/remote/akka/tcp/localhost:89/$a` as a routee and begins routing messages to it over the network;
4. localhost:91 joins the cluster and a `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message gets generated on each member.
5. `Pool` router on localhost:89 receives the `ClusterEvent.MemberUp` message;
6. `Pool` router REMOTE DEPLOYS `akka.tcp://Sys@localhost:91/remote/akka/tcp/localhost:89/$b` as a routee and begins routing messages to it over the network.

If either localhost:90 or localhost:91 dies following this setup the remote deployed routee will be killed and the `Pool` router will be notified via `Deathwatch`. If there's capacity available (we'll explain in a moment,) the `Pool` router will replace the dead routee by deploying a new routee onto another qualified node.

## Cluster Router Config
Here are the essential options you will use to configure cluster-aware routers.

### All Clustered Routers
- **`enabled`**: this must be set to `on` in order for this to be a clustered router.
- **`allow-local-routees`**: determines if routee actors are allowed to be located on the same node as router actor, or only on remote nodes. Setting this to `off` means that all the routees for this router will exist on different nodes in the cluster.
- `nr-of-instances`: this is the maximum number of total routees that this router will route to.
- **`use-role`**: depends on whether router is a `Pool` or `Group` router

### Clustered `Group` Router Config
- **`nr-of-instances`**: this is the maximum number of total routees that this router will route to.
- **`max-nr-of-instances-per-node`**: this does not apply to `Group` routers.
- **`routees.paths`**: the comma-separated path(s) of the routees on each node in the cluster.
    + This setting can use what's called a *wildcard* path, meaning we don't care about the name of the actor in the `*` position. e.g. [in the Webcrawler sample,](https://github.com/petabridge/akkadotnet-code-samples/blob/master/Cluster.WebCrawler/src/WebCrawler.Service/App.config#L38) as long as the actor being deployed is named `coordinators` and the grandparent is named `api`, then this deployment configuration can be safely reused. You can write [`ActorSelection`s](/concepts/addressing.md#summary-actorof-vs-actorselection-) using wildcard paths also!
    + You do *not* need to specify `/user` at the start of each path. It is implied.
- **`use-role`**: the `Group` router will only route to routees at the specified `paths` on nodes marked with the given role. Can only specify one role here.

#### HOCON for Clustered `Group` Routers
Here's an example of what the HOCON for a clustered `Group` router looks like, [taken from the WebCrawler sample](https://github.com/petabridge/akkadotnet-code-samples/tree/master/Cluster.WebCrawler):

```xml
akka {
   actor{
      provider = cluster
      deployment {
        /api/myClusterGroupRouter {
          router = broadcast-group # routing strategy
          routees.paths = ["/user/api"] # path of routee on each node
          nr-of-instances = 3 # max number of total routees
          cluster {
             enabled = on
             allow-local-routees = on
             use-role = crawler
          }
        }
      }
   }
}
```

### Clustered `Pool` Router Config
- **`nr-of-instances`**: this is the maximum number of total routees that this router will first deploy, and then route to.
- **`max-nr-of-instances-per-node`**: the maximum number of routees that the `Pool` router will deploy onto a given cluster node.
    - Note that `nr-of-instances` defines total number of routees, but number of routees per node will not be exceeded, i.e. if you define `nr-of-instances = 50` and `max-nr-of-instances-per-node = 2`, the router will deploy 2 routees per new node in the cluster, up to 25 nodes.
- **`use-role`**: router will only deploy routees onto nodes in the cluster marked with the given role. Can only specify one role here.

#### HOCON for Clustered `Pool` Routers
Here's an example of what the HOCON for a clustered `Pool` router looks like:

```xml
akka {
   actor{
      provider = cluster
      deployment {
        /api/myClusterPoolRouter {
          router = round-robin-pool # routing strategy
          nr-of-instances = 10 # max number of total routees
          cluster {
             enabled = on
             allow-local-routees = on
             use-role = crawler
             max-nr-of-instances-per-node = 1
          }
        }
      }
   }
}
```
