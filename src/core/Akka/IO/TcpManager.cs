    /// INTERNAL API
    /// 
    /// TcpManager is a facade for accepting commands (<see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Command"/>) to open client or server TCP connections.
    /// 
    /// TcpManager is obtainable by calling {{{ IO(Tcp) }}} (see [[akka.io.IO]] and [[akka.io.Tcp]])
    /// 
    /// == Bind ==
    /// 
    /// To bind and listen to a local address, a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Bind"/> command must be sent to this actor. If the binding
    /// was successful, the sender of the <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Bind"/> will be notified with a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Bound"/>
    /// message. The sender() of the <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Bound"/> message is the Listener actor (an internal actor responsible for
    /// listening to server events). To unbind the port an <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Unbind"/> message must be sent to the Listener actor.
    /// 
    /// If the bind request is rejected because the Tcp system is not able to register more channels (see the nr-of-selectors
    /// and max-channels configuration options in the akka.io.tcp section of the configuration) the sender will be notified
    /// with a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.CommandFailed"/> message. This message contains the original command for reference.
    /// 
    /// When an inbound TCP connection is established, the handler will be notified by a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Connected"/> message.
    /// The sender of this message is the Connection actor (an internal actor representing the TCP connection). At this point
    /// the procedure is the same as for outbound connections (see section below).
    /// 
    /// == Connect ==
    /// 
    /// To initiate a connection to a remote server, a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Connect"/> message must be sent to this actor. If the
    /// connection succeeds, the sender() will be notified with a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Connected"/> message. The sender of the
    /// <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Connected"/> message is the Connection actor (an internal actor representing the TCP connection). Before
    /// starting to use the connection, a handler must be registered to the Connection actor by sending a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Register"/>
    /// command message. After a handler has been registered, all incoming data will be sent to the handler in the form of
    /// <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Received"/> messages. To write data to the connection, a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.Write"/> message must be sent
    /// to the Connection actor.
    /// 
    /// If the connect request is rejected because the Tcp system is not able to register more channels (see the nr-of-selectors
    /// and max-channels configuration options in the akka.io.tcp section of the configuration) the sender will be notified
    /// with a <see cref="Akka.IO.Tcp.CommandFailed"/> message. This message contains the original command for reference.
