#### 1.4.0-beta2 July 29 2019 ####
Placeholder for nightlies.

#### 1.3.14 July 29 2019 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**
You know what? We're going to stop promising that _this_ is the last 1.3.x release, because even though we've said that twice... We now have _another_ 1.3.x release. 

1.3.14 consists of non-breaking bugfixes and additions that have been contributed against the [Akka.NET v1.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/17) thus far. These include:

* Akka.Cluster.Sharding: default "persistent" mode has been stabilized and errors that users have ran into during `ShardCoordinator` recovery, such as [Exception in PersistentShardCoordinator ReceiveRecover](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3414);
* [Akka.Remote: no longer disassociates when serialization errors are thrown](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3782) in the remoting pipeline - the connection will now stay open;
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: mission-critical `ClusterClient` and `ClusterClientReceptionist` fixes](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3866);
* [SourceLink debugging support for Akka.NET](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3848); and
* [Akka.Persistence: Allow AtLeastOnceDelivery parameters to be set from deriving classes](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3810); 
* [Akka.Persistence.Sql: BatchingSqlJournal now preserves Sender in PersistCallback](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3779); and
* [Akka: bugfix - coordinated shutdown timesout when exit-clr = on](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3815).

#### 1.4.0-beta1 July 17 2019 ####
**First pre-release candidate for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4 has a ways to go before it's fully ready for market, but this is the first publicly available release on NuGet and it contains some massive changes.

* Akka.Cluster.Sharding's default "persistent" mode has been stabilized and errors that users have ran into during `ShardCoordinator` recovery, such as [Exception in PersistentShardCoordinator ReceiveRecover](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3414)
* StreamRefs have been added to Akka.Streams, which allows streams to run across process boundaries and over Akka.Remote / Akka.Cluster.
* Akka.NET now targets .NET Standard 2.0, which means many annoying polyfills and other hacks we needed to add in order to support .NET Core 1.1 are now gone and replaced with standard APIs.
* Lots of small bug fixes and API changes have been added to Akka core and other libraries.

#### 1.3.11 December 17 2018 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

Akka.NET v1.3.11 is a bugfix patch primarily aimed at solving the following issue: [DotNetty Remote Transport Issues with .NET Core 2.1](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3506).

.NET Core 2.1 exposed some issues with the DotNetty connection methods in DotNetty v0.4.8 that have since been fixed in subsequent releases. In Akka.NET v1.3.11 we've resolved this issue by upgrading to DotNetty v0.6.0.

In addition to the above, we've introduced some additional fixes and changes in Akka.NET v1.3.11:

* [Akka.FSharp: Akka.Fsharp spawning an actor results in Exception](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3402)
* [Akka.Remote: tcp-reuse-addr = off-for-windows prevents actorsystem from starting](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3293)
* [Akka.Remote: tcp socket address reuse - default configuration](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/2477)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: 
Actor still receiving messages from mediator after termination](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3658)

#### 1.3.9 August 22 2018 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

Akka.NET v1.3.9 features some major changes to Akka.Cluster.Sharding, additional Akka.Streams stages, and some general bug fixes across the board.

**Akka.Cluster.Sharding Improvements**
The [Akka.Cluster.Sharding documentation](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html#quickstart) already describes some of the major changes in Akka.NET v1.3.9, but we figured it would be worth calling special attention to those changes here.

**Props Factory for Entity Actors**

> In some cases, the actor may need to know the `entityId` associated with it. This can be achieved using the `entityPropsFactory` parameter to `ClusterSharding.Start` or `ClusterSharding.StartAsync`. The entity ID will be passed to the factory as a parameter, which can then be used in the creation of the actor.

In addition to the existing APIs we've always had for defining sharded entities via `Props`, Akka.NET v1.3.9 introduces [a new method overload for `Start`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_Start_System_String_System_Func_System_String_Akka_Actor_Props__Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterShardingSettings_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractEntityId_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractShardId_) and [`StartAsync`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_StartAsync_System_String_System_Func_System_String_Akka_Actor_Props__Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterShardingSettings_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractEntityId_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractShardId_) which allows users to pass in the `entityId` of each entity actor as a constructor argument to those entities when they start.

For example:

```
var anotherCounterShard = ClusterSharding.Get(Sys).Start(
	                        typeName: "AnotherCounter",
	                        entityProps: Props.Create<AnotherCounter>(),
	                        typeName: AnotherCounter.ShardingTypeName,
	                        entityPropsFactory: entityId => AnotherCounter.Props(entityId),
	                        settings: ClusterShardingSettings.Create(Sys),
	                        extractEntityId: Counter.ExtractEntityId,
	                        extractShardId: Counter.ExtractShardId);
```

This will give you the opportunity to pass in the `entityId` for each actor as a constructor argument into the `Props` of your entity actor and possibly other use cases too. 

**Improvements to Starting and Querying Existing Shard Entity Types**
Two additional major usability improvements to Cluster.Sharding come from some API additions and changes.

The first is that it's now possible to look up all of the currently registered shard types via the [`ClusterSharding.ShardTypeNames` property](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_ShardTypeNames). So long as a `ShardRegion` of that type has been started in the cluster, that entity type name will be added to the collection exposed by this property.

The other major usability improvement is a change to the `ClusterSharding.Start` property itself. Historically, you used to have to know whether or not the node you wanted to use sharding on was going to be hosting shards (call `ClusterSharding.Start`) or simply communicated with shards hosted on a different cluster role type (call `ClusterSharding.StartProxy`). Going forward, it's safe to call `ClusterSharding.Start` on any node and you will either receive an `IActorRef` to active `ShardRegion` or a `ShardRegion` running in "proxy only" mode; this is determined by looking at the `ClusterShardingSettings` and determining if the current node is in a role that is allowed to host shards of this type.

* [Akka.Cluster.Sharding: Sharding API Updates](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3524)
* [Akka.Cluster.Sharding: sharding rebalance fix](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3518)
* [Akka.Cluster.Sharding: log formatting fix](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3554)
* [Akka.Cluster.Sharding: `RestartShard` escapes into userspace](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3509)

**Akka.Streams Additions and Changes**
In Akka.NET v1.3.9 we've added some new built-in stream stages and API methods designed to help improve developer productivity and ease of use.

* [Akka.Streams: add CombineMaterialized method to Source](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3489)
* [Akka.Streams: 
KillSwitches: flow stage from CancellationToken](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3568)

* [Akka.Streams: Port PagedSource & IntervalBasedRateLimiter](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3570)

**Other Updates, Additions, and Bugfixes**
* [Akka.Cluster: cluster coordinated leave fix for empty cluster](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3516)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: bumped ClusterClient message drop log messages from DEBUG to WARNING](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3513)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: Singleton - confirm TakeOverFromMe when singleton already in oldest state](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3553)

#### 1.3.8 June 04 2018 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

Akka.NET v1.3.8 is a minor patch consisting mostly of bug fixes as well as an upgrade to DotNetty v0.4.8.

**DotNetty v0.4.8 Upgrade**
You can [read the release notes for DotNetty v0.4.8 here](https://github.com/Azure/DotNetty/blob/5eee925b7597c6b07689f25f328966e330ff58f9/RELEASE_NOTES.md) - but here are the major improvements as they pertain to Akka.NET:

1. DotNetty length-frame decoding is now fully-supported on .NET Core on Linux and
2. Socket shutdown code has been improved, which fixes a potential "port exhaustion" issue reported by Akka.Remote users.

If you've been affected by either of these issues, we strongly encourage that you upgrade your applications to Akka.NET v1.3.8 as soon as possible.

**Updates and Additions**
1. [Akka.Streams: add PreMaterialize support for Sources](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3476)

#### 1.3.7 May 15 2018 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

Akka.NET v1.3.7 is a minor patch consisting mostly of bug fixes.

**DotNetty stabilization**
We've had a number of issues related to DotNetty issues over recent weeks, and we've resolved those in this patch by doing the following:

* [Locking down the version of DotNetty to v0.4.6 until further notice](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3410)
* [Resolving memory leaks introduced with DotNetty in v1.3.6](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3436)

We will be upgrading to DotNetty v0.4.8 in a near future release, but in the meantime this patch fixes critical issues introduced in v1.3.6.

**Bugfixes**
1. [Akka.Persistence.Sql: Slow reading of big snapshots](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3422) - this will require a recompilation of all Akka.Persistence.Sql-type Akka.Persistence plugins.
2. [Akka.Fsharp: spawning an actor results in Exception in 1.3.6 release](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3402)

#### 1.3.3 January 19 2018 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

The largest changes featured in Akka.NET v1.3.3 are the introduction of [Splint brain resolvers](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/split-brain-resolver.html) and `WeaklyUp` members in Akka.Cluster.

**Akka.Cluster Split Brain Resolvers**
Split brain resolvers are specialized [`IDowningProvider`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.IDowningProvider.html) implementations that give Akka.Cluster users the ability to automatically down `Unreachable` cluster nodes in accordance with well-defined partition resolution strategies, namely:

* Static quorums;
* Keep majority;
* Keep oldest; and 
* Keep-referee.

You can learn more about why you may want to use these and which strategy is right for you by reading our [Splint brain resolver documentation](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/split-brain-resolver.html).

**Akka.Cluster `WeaklyUp` Members**
One common problem that occurs in Akka.Cluster is that once a current member of the cluster becomes `Unreachable`, the leader of the cluster isn't able to allow any new members of the cluster to join until that `Unreachable` member becomes `Reachable` again or is removed from the cluster via a [`Cluster.Down` command](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Cluster.html#Akka_Cluster_Cluster_Down_Akka_Actor_Address_).

Beginning in Akka.NET 1.3.3, you can allow nodes to still join and participate in the cluster even while other member nodes are unreachable by opting into the `WeaklyUp` status for members. You can do this by setting the following in your HOCON configuration beginning in Akka.NET v1.3.3:

```
akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members = on
```

This will allow nodes who have joined the cluster when at least one other member was unreachable to become functioning cluster members with a status of `WeaklyUp`. If the unreachable members of the cluster are downed or become reachable again, all `WeaklyUp` nodes will be upgraded to the usual `Up` status for available cluster members.

**Akka.Cluster.Sharding and Akka.Cluster.DistributedData Integration**
A new experimental feature we've added in Akka.NET v1.3.3 is the ability to fully decouple [Akka.Cluster.Sharding](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html) from Akka.Persistence and instead run it on top of [Akka.Cluster.DistributedData, our library for creating eventually consistent replicated data structures on top of Akka.Cluster](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/distributed-data.html).

Beginning in Akka.NET 1.3.3, you can set the following HOCON configuration option to have the `ShardingCoordinator` replicate its shard placement state using DData instead of persisting it to storage via Akka.Persistence:

```
akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode = ddata
```

This setting only affects how Akka.Cluster.Sharding's internal state is managed. If you're using Akka.Persistence with your own entity actors inside Akka.Cluster.Sharding, this change will have no impact on them.

**Updates and bugfixes**:
* [Added `Cluster.JoinAsync` and `Clutser.JoinSeedNodesAsync` methods](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3196)
* [Updated Akka.Serialization.Hyperion to Hyperion v0.9.7](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3279) - see [Hyperion v0.9.7 release notes here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Hyperion/releases/tag/v0.9.7).
* [Fixed: A Source.SplitAfter Akka example extra output](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3222)
* [Fixed: Udp.Received give incorrect ByteString when client send several packets at once](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3210)
* [Fixed: TcpOutgoingConnection does not dispose properly - memory leak](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3211)
* [Fixed: Akka.IO & WSAEWOULDBLOCK socket error](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3188)
* [Fixed: Sharding-RegionProxyTerminated fix](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3192)

* [Fixed: Persistence - fix double return of recovery permit](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3201)
* [Change: Changed Akka.IO configured buffer-size to 512B](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3176)

#### 1.3.1 September 5 2017 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**

**Updates and bugfixes**:

- Bugfix: Hyperion NuGet package restore creating duplicate assemblies for the same version inside Akka
- Various documentation fixes and updates
- Bugfix: issue where data sent via UDP when `ByteString` payload had buffers with length more than 1, `UdpSender` only wrote the first part of the buffers and dropped the rest.
- Bugfix: Akka.IO.Tcp failed to write some outgoing messages.
- Improved support for OSX & Rider
- Bugfix: Akka.Persistence support for `SerializerWithStringManifest` required by Akka.Cluster.Sharding and Akka.Cluster.Tools
	- Akka.Persistence.Sqlite and Akka.Persistence.SqlServer were unable to support `SerializerWithStringManifest`, so using Akka.Cluster.Sharding with Sql plugins would not work.
- Bugfix: Akka.Streams generic type parameters of the flow returned from current implementation of Bidiflow's JoinMat method were incorrect.
- Bugfix: `PersistenceMessageSerializer` was failing with the wrong exception when a non-supported type was provided.

**Akka.Persistence backwards compability warning**:

- Akka.Persistence.Sql introduces an additional field to the schema used by Sql-based plugins to allow for the use of `SerializerWithStringManifest` called `serializer_id`.  It requires any previous Sql schema to be updated to have this field.  Details are included in the Akka.Persistence.Sqlite plugin README.md file.  Users of the Akka.Persistence.Sqlite plugin must alter their existing databases to add the field `serializer_id int (4)`:

```
ALTER TABLE {your_event_journal_table_name} ADD COLUMN `serializer_id` INTEGER ( 4 )
ALTER TABLE {your_snapshot_table_name} ADD COLUMN `serializer_id` INTEGER ( 4 )
```

#### 1.3.0 August 11 2017 ####
**Feature Release for Akka.NET**
Akka.NET 1.3.0 is a major feature release that introduces the significant changes to Akka.NET and its runtime.

**.NET Core and .NET Standard 1.6 Support**
This release introduces support for .NET Standard 1.6 for our core libraries and .NET Core 1.1 for the MultiNode Test Runner standalone executable. All packages for Akka.NET are dual-released under both .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 1.6.

As a side note: Akka.NET on .NET 4.5 is not wire compatible with Akka.NET on .NET Core; this is due to fundamental changes made to the base types in the CLR on .NET Core. It's a common problem facing many different serializers and networking libraries in .NET at the moment. You can use a X-plat serializer we've developed here: https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/2947 - please comment on that thread if you're considering building hybrid .NET and .NET Core clusters.

**Akka.Persistence Released to Market**
Akka.Persistence has graduated from beta status to stable modules and its interfaces are now considered to be stable. We'll begin updating all of the Akka.Persistence plugins to stable and to add .NET Standard / .NET 4.5 support to each of them as well following this patch.

**DocFx-based Documentation Site**
Documentation is now generated using DocFx and compiled from within the Akka.NET project rather than a separate documentation repository. 

**API Changes**
This release does **not** maintain wire format compatibility with the previous release (v1.2.3) inside Akka.Remote; primarily this is due to having to upgrade from Google Protobuf2 to Protobuf3 in order to add .NET Standard support, but we've also taken the liberty of making other serialization improvements while we're at it. So be advised that during an upgrade from 1.2.* to 1.3.* there will be periods of network disruption between nodes using different versions of the service.

**Akka.Remote Performance Improvements**
Akka.Remote's throughput has been significantly increased.

#### 1.2.0 April 11 2017 ####
**Feature Release for Akka.NET**
Akka.NET 1.2 is a major feature release that introduces the following major changes:

**Akka.Remote now uses [DotNetty](https://github.com/azure/dotnetty) for its transport layer**
The biggest change for 1.2 is the removal of Helios 2.0 as the default transport and the introduction of DotNetty. The new DotNetty transport is fully backwards compatible with the Helios 1.4 and 2.* transports, so you should be able to upgrade from any Akka.NET 1.* application to 1.2 without any downtime. All of the `helios.tcp` HOCON is also supported by the DotNetty transport, so none of that needs to updated for the DotNetty transport to work out of the box.

In addition, the DotNetty transport supports TLS, which can be enabled via the following HOCON:

```
akka {
  loglevel = DEBUG
  actor {
    provider = Akka.Remote.RemoteActorRefProvider,Akka.Remote
  }
  remote {
    dot-netty.tcp {
      port = 0
      hostname = 127.0.0.1
      enable-ssl = true
      log-transport = true
      ssl {
        suppress-validation = true
        certificate {
          # valid ssl certificate must be installed on both hosts
          path = "<valid certificate path>" 
          password = "<certificate password>"
          # flags is optional: defaults to "default-flag-set" key storage flag
          # other available storage flags:
          #   exportable | machine-key-set | persist-key-set | user-key-set | user-protected
          flags = [ "default-flag-set" ] 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can [read more about Akka.Remote's TLS support here](http://getakka.net/docs/remoting/security#akka-remote-with-tls-transport-layer-security-).

See [the complete DotNetty transport HOCON here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/core/Akka.Remote/Configuration/Remote.conf#L318).

**Akka.Streams and Akka.Cluster.Tools RTMed**
Akka.Streams and Akka.Cluster.Tools have graduated from beta status to stable modules and their interfaces are now considered to be stable.

**CoordinatedShutdown**
One of the major improvements in Akka.NET 1.2 is the addition of the new `CoordinatedShutdown` plugin, which is designed to make it easier for nodes that are running Akka.Cluster to automatically exit a cluster gracefully whenever `ActorSystem.Terminate` is called or when the process the node is running in attempts to exit. `CoordinatedShutdown` is fully extensible and can be used to schedule custom shutdown operations as part of `ActorSystem` termination.

You can [read more about how to use `CoordinatedShutdown` here](http://getakka.net/docs/working-with-actors/coordinated-shutdown).

**Additional Changes**
In addition to the above changes, there have been a large number of performance improvements, bug fixes, and documentation improvements made to Akka.NET in 1.2. [Read the full list of changes in Akka.NET 1.2 here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/13).

#### 1.1.3 January 22 2017 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.1**

Akka.NET v1.1.3 features some new libraries and an enormous number of bug fixes.

**Akka.DistributedData Beta**
First, we've introduced an alpha of a new module intended for use with Akka.Cluster: Akka.DistributedData. The goal of this library is to make it possible to concurrently read and write replicated copies of the same entity across different nodes in the cluster using conflict-free replicated data types, often referred to as "CRDTs." These replicas can eventually be merged together in a fully consistent manner and are excellent choices for applications that require a high level of availability and partition tolerance.

The library is still a bit of a work in progress at the moment, but you are free to use it via the following command:

```
PS> Install-Package Akka.DistributedData -pre
```

**Akka.Serialization.Wire Deprecated; Replaced with Akka.Serialization.Hyperion**
Wire recently changed its license to GPLv3, which is a poor fit for a technology like Akka.NET. Therefore, our default serializer beginning in Akka.NET 1.5 will be [Hyperion](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Hyperion) instead. You can see how to set it up here: http://getakka.net/docs/Serialization#how-to-setup-hyperion-as-default-serializer

**Other bug fixes, performance improvements, and changes**

#### 1.1.2 September 21 2016 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.1**

Akka.NET 1.1.2 introduces some exciting developments for Akka.NET users.

**Mono Support and Improved IPV4/6 Configuration**
First, Akka.NET 1.1.2 is the first release of Akka.NET to be production-certified for Mono. We've made some changes to Akka.Remote, in particular, to design it to work within some of the confines of Mono 4.4.2. For instance, we now support the following HOCON configuration value for the default Helios TCP transport:

```
 helios.tcp {
	  # Omitted for brevity
      transport-protocol = tcp

      port = 2552

      hostname = ""

	  public-hostname = ""

	  dns-use-ipv6 = false
	  enforce-ip-family = false
}
```

`helios.tcp.enforce-ip-family` is a new setting added to the `helios.tcp` transport designed to allow Akka.Remote to function in environments that don't support IPV6. This includes Mono 4.4.2, Windows Azure WebApps, and possibly others. When this setting is turned on and `dns-use-ipv6 = false`, all sockets will be forced to use IPV4 only instead of dual mode. If this setting is turned on and `dns-use-ipv6 = true`, all sockets opened by the Helios transport will be forced to use IPV6 instead of dual-mode.

Currently, as of Mono 4.4.2, this setting is turned on by default. Mono 4.6, when it's released, will allow dual-mode to work consistently again in the future.

We run the entire Akka.NET test suite on Mono and all modules pass.

**Akka.Cluster Downing Providers**
We've added a new feature to Akka.Cluster known as a "downing provider" - this is a pluggable strategy that you can configure via HOCON to specify how nodes in your Akka.NET cluster may automatically mark unreachable nodes as down.

Out of the box Akka.Cluster only provides the default "auto-down" strategy that's been included as part of Akka.Cluster in the past. However, you can now subclass the `Akka.Cluster.IDowningProvider` interface to implement your own strategies, which you can then load through HOCON:

```
# i.e.: akka.cluster.downing-provider-class = "Akka.Cluster.Tests.FailingDowningProvider, Akka.Cluster.Tests"
akka.cluster.downing-provider-class = "Fully-qualified-type-name, Assembly"
```

**Other Fixes**
We've also made significant improvements to the Akka.NET scheduler, more than doubling its performance and an significantly decreasing its memory allocation and garbage collection; updated Akka.Streams; fixed bugs in Akka.Cluster routers; and more. You [can read the full list of changes in 1.1.2 here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/11).

#### 1.1.1 July 15 2016 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.1**

Akka.NET 1.1.1 addresses a number of bugs and issues reported by end users who made the upgrade from Akka.NET 1.0.* to Akka.NET 1.1. 

**DNS improvements**
The biggest set of fixes included in Akka.NET 1.1.1 deal with how the Helios transport treats IPV6 addresses and performs DNS resolution. In Akka.NET 1.0.* Helios only supported IPV4 addresses and would use that as the default for DNS. In Akka.NET 1.1 we upgraded to using Helios 2.1, which supports both IPV6 and IPV4, but *changed the default DNS resolution strategy to use IPV6.* This caused some breakages for users who were using the `public-hostname` setting inside Helios in combination with a `hostname` value that used an IPV4 address.

This is now fixed - Akka.NET 1.1.1 uses Helios 2.1.2 which defaults back to an IPV4 DNS resolution strategy for both inbound and outbound connections. We've also fixed the way we encode and format IPV6 addresses into `ActorPath` and `Address` string representations (although we [still have an issue with parsing IPV6 from HOCON](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/2187).)

If you need to use IPV6 for DNS resolution, you can enable it by changing the following setting:

`akka.remote.helios.tcp.dns-use-ipv6 = true`

You can [see the full list of Akka.NET 1.1.1 changes here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/9).

#### 1.1.0 July 05 2016 ####
**Feature Release for Akka.NET**

In Akka.NET 1.1 we introduce the following major changes:

* Akka.Cluster is no longer in beta; it is released as a fully stable module with a frozen API that is ready for production use.
* Akka.Remote now has a new Helios 2.1 transport that is up to 5x faster than the previous implementation and with tremendously lower memory consumption.
* The actor mailbox system has been replaced with the `MailboxType` system, which standardizes all mailbox implementations on a common core and instead allows for pluggable `IMessageQueue` implementations. This will make it easier to develop user-defined mailboxes and also has the added benefit of reducing all actor memory footprints by 34%.
* The entire router system has been updated, including support for new "controller" actors that can be used to adjust a router's routing table in accordance to external events (i.e. a router that adjusts whom it routes to based on CPU utilization, which will be implemented in Akka.Cluster.Metrics).

[Full list of Akka.NET 1.1 fixes and changes](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/6)

**API Changes**
There have been a couple of important API changes which will affect end-users upgrading from Akka.NET versions 1.0.*.

First breaking change deals with the `PriorityMailbox` base class, used by developers who need to prioritize specific message types ahead of others.

All user-defined instances of this type must now include the following constructor in order to work (using an example from Akka.NET itself:)

```csharp
public class IntPriorityMailbox : UnboundedPriorityMailbox
{
    protected override int PriorityGenerator(object message)
    {
        return message as int? ?? Int32.MaxValue;
    }

    public IntPriorityMailbox(Settings settings, Config config) : base(settings, config)
    {
    }
}
```

There must be a `MyMailboxType(Settings settings, Config config)` constructor on all custom mailbox types going forward, or a `ConfigurationException` will be thrown when trying to instantiate an actor who uses the mailbox type.

Second breaking change deals with Akka.Cluster itself. In the past you could access all manner of data from the `ClusterReadView` class (accessed via the `Cluster.ReadView` property) - such as the addresses of all other members, who the current leader was, and so forth.

Going forward `ClusterReadView` is now marked as `internal`, but if you need access to any of this data you can access the `Cluster.State` property, which will return a [`CurrentClusterState`](http://api.getakka.net/docs/stable/html/CFFD0D89.htm) object. This contains most of the same information that was previously available on `ClusterReadView`.

**Akka.Streams**
Another major part of Akka.NET 1.1 is the introduction of [Akka.Streams](http://getakka.net/docs/streams/introduction), a powerful library with a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows you to compose Akka.NET actors and workflows into streams of events and messages. 

As of 1.1 Akka.Streams is now available as a beta module on NuGet.

We highly recommend that you read the [Akka.Streams Quick Start Guide for Akka.NET](http://getakka.net/docs/streams/quickstart) as a place to get started.

**Akka.Persistence.Query**
A second beta module is also now available as part of Akka.NET 1.1, Akka.Persistence.Query - this module is built on top of Akka.Streams and Akka.Persistence and allows users to query ranges of information directly from their underlying Akka.Persistence stores for more powerful types of reads, aggregations, and more.

Akka.Persistence.Query is available for all SQL implementations of Akka.Persistence and will be added to our other Akka.Persistence plugins shortly thereafter.

**Thank you!**
Thanks for all of your patience and support as we worked to deliver this to you - it's been a tremendous amount of work but we really appreciate the help of all of the bug reports, Gitter questions, StackOverflow questions, and testing that our users have done on Akka.NET and specifically, Akka.Cluster over the past two years. We couldn't have done this without you.

#### 1.0.7 April 4 2016 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.0.6**
The biggest changes in Akka.NET 1.0.7 have been made to Akka.Persistence, which is now designed to match the final stable release version in JVM Akka 2.4. Akka.Persistence is on-target to exit beta and become a fully mature module as of Akka.NET 1.5, due in May/June timeframe.

A quick note about 1.5 - JSON.NET will be replaced by Wire as the default serializer going forward, so if you want to be forward-compatible with 1.5 you will need to switch to using Wire today. [Learn how to switch to using Wire as the default Akka.NET serializer](http://getakka.net/docs/Serialization#how-to-setup-wire-as-default-serializer).

If you install 1.0.7 you may see the following warning appear:

> NewtonSoftJsonSerializer has been detected as a default serializer. 
> It will be obsoleted in Akka.NET starting from version 1.5 in the favor of Wire
for more info visit: http://getakka.net/docs/Serialization#how-to-setup-wire-as-default-serializer
> If you want to suppress this message set HOCON `{configPath}` config flag to on.

This release also fixes some issues with the Cluster.Tools and Cluster.Sharding NuGet packages, which weren't versioned correctly in previous releases.

#### 1.0.6 January 18 2016 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.0.5**
This patch consists of many bug fixes, performance improvements, as well as the addition of two brand new alpha modules for Akka.Cluster users.

**Akka.Cluster.Tools** and **Akka.Cluster.Sharding**
The biggest part of this release is the addition of [Akka.Cluster.Tools](http://getakka.net/docs/clustering/cluster-tools) and [Akka.Cluster.Sharding](http://getakka.net/docs/clustering/cluster-sharding), both of which are available now as pre-release packages on NuGet.

```
PM> Install-Package Akka.Cluster.Tools -pre
```
and

```
PM> Install-Package Akka.Cluster.Sharding -pre
```

Respectively, these two packages extend Akka.Cluster to do the following:

1. Distributed pub/sub (Akka.Cluster.Tools)
2. `ClusterClient` - subscribe to changes in cluster availability without actually being part of the cluster itself. (Akka.Cluster.Tools)
3. `ClusterSingleton` - guarantee a single instance of a specific actor throughout the cluster. (Akka.Cluster.Tools)
4. Sharding - partition data into durable stores (built on top of Akka.Persistence) in a manner that is fault-tolerant and recoverable across thecluster. (Akka.Cluster.Sharding)

Check out the documentation for more details!
* http://getakka.net/docs/clustering/cluster-tools

#### 1.0.4 August 07 2015 ####
**Maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.0.3**

**Akka.IO**
This release introduces some major new features to Akka.NET, including [Akka.IO - a new set of capabilities built directly into the Akka NuGet package that allow you to communicate with your actors directly via TCP and UDP sockets](http://getakka.net/docs/IO) from external (non-actor) systems.

If you want to see a really cool example of Akka.IO in action, look at [this sample that shows off how to use the Telnet commandline to interact directly with Akka.NET actors](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/examples/TcpEchoService.Server).

**Akka.Persistence.MongoDb** and **Akka.Persistence.Sqlite**
Two new flavors of Akka.Persistence support are now available. You can install them via the commandline!

```
PM> Install-Package Akka.Persistence.MongoDb -pre
```
and

```
PM> Install-Package Akka.Persistence.Sqlite -pre
```

#### 1.0.0 Apr 09 2015

**Akka.NET is officially no longer in beta status**. The APIs introduced in Akka.NET v1.0 will enjoy long-term support from the Akka.NET development team and all of its professional support partners.

Many breaking changes were introduced between v0.8 and v1.0 in order to provide better future extensibility and flexibility for Akka.NET, and we will outline the major changes in detail in these release notes.

However, if you want full API documentation we recommend going to the following:

* **[Latest Stable Akka.NET API Docs](http://api.getakka.net/docs/stable/index.html "Akka.NET Latest Stable API Docs")**
* **[Akka.NET Wiki](http://getakka.net/wiki/ "Akka.NET Wiki")**

----

**Updated Packages with 1.0 Stable Release**

All of the following NuGet packages have been upgraded to 1.0 for stable release:

- Akka.NET Core
- Akka.FSharp
- Akka.Remote
- Akka.TestKit
- Akka.DI (dependency injection)
- Akka.Loggers (logging)

The following packages (and modules dependent on them) are still in *pre-release* status:

- Akka.Cluster
- Akka.Persistence

----
**Introducing Full Mono Support for Akka.NET**

One of the biggest changes in Akka.NET v1.0 is the introduction of full Mono support across all modules; we even have [Raspberry PI machines talking to laptops over Akka.Remote](https://twitter.com/AkkaDotNET/status/584109606714093568)!

We've tested everything using Mono v3.12.1 across OS X and Ubuntu. 

**[Please let us know how well Akka.NET + Mono runs on your environment](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/694)!**

----

**API Changes in v1.0**

**All methods returning an `ActorRef` now return `IActorRef`**
This is the most significant breaking change introduced in AKka.NET v1.0. Rather than returning the `ActorRef` abstract base class from all of the `ActorOf`, `Sender` and other methods we now return an instance of the `IActorRef` interface instead.

This was done in order to guarantee greater future extensibility without additional breaking changes, so we decided to pay off that technical debt now that we're supporting these APIs long-term.

Here's the set of breaking changes you need to be aware of:

- Renamed:
  - `ActorRef`          --> `IActorRef`
  - `ActorRef.Nobody`   --> `ActorRefs.Nobody`
  - `ActorRef.NoSender` --> `ActorRefs.NoSender`
- `ActorRef`'s  operators `==` and `!=` has been removed. This means all expressions like `actorRef1 == actorRef2` must be replaced with `Equals(actorRef1, actorRef2)`
- `Tell(object message)`, i.e. the implicit sender overload, has been moved
to an extension method, and requires `using Akka.Actor;` to be accessible.
- Implicit cast from `ActorRef` to `Routee` has been replaced with `Routee.FromActorRef(actorRef)`

**`async` / `await` Support**

`ReceiveActor`s now support Async/Await out of the box.

```csharp
public class MyActor : ReceiveActor
{
       public MyActor()
       {
             Receive<SomeMessage>(async some => {
                    //we can now safely use await inside this receive handler
                    await SomeAsyncIO(some.Data);
                    Sender.Tell(new EverythingIsAllOK());                   
             });
       }
}
```

It is also possible to specify the behavior for the async handler, using `AsyncBehavior.Suspend` and  `AsyncBehavior.Reentrant` as the first argument.
When using `Suspend` the normal actor semantics will be preserved, the actor will not be able to process any new messages until the current async operation is completed.
While using `Reentrant` will allow the actor to multiplex messages during the `await` period.
This does not mean that messages are processed in parallel, we still stay true to "one message at a time", but each await continuation will be piped back to the actor as a message and continue under the actors concurrency constraint.

However, `PipeTo` pattern is still the preferred way to perform async operations inside an actor, as it is more explicit and clearly states what is going on.


**Switchable Behaviors**
In order to make the switchable behavior APIs more understandable for both `UntypedActor` and `ReceiveActor` we've updated the methods to the following:

``` C#
Become(newHandler); // become newHandler, without adding previous behavior to the stack (default)
BecomeStacked(newHandler); // become newHandler, without adding previous behavior to the stack (default)
UnbecomeStacked(); //revert to the previous behavior in the stack
```

The underlying behavior-switching implementation hasn't changed at all - only the names of the methods.

**Scheduler APIs**
The `Context.System.Scheduler` API has been overhauled to be both more extensible and understandable going forward. All of the previous capabilities for the `Scheduler` are still available, only in different packaging than they were before.

Here are the new APIs:

``` C#
Context.System.Scheduler
  .ScheduleTellOnce(TimeSpan delay, ICanTell receiver, object message, ActorRef sender);
  .ScheduleTellOnce(TimeSpan delay, ICanTell receiver, object message, ActorRef sender, ICancelable cancelable);
  .ScheduleTellRepeatedly(TimeSpan initialDelay, TimeSpan interval, ICanTell receiver, object message, ActorRef sender);
  .ScheduleTellRepeatedly(TimeSpan initialDelay, TimeSpan interval, ICanTell receiver, object message, ActorRef sender, ICancelable cancelable);

Context.System.Scheduler.Advanced
  .ScheduleOnce(TimeSpan delay, Action action);
  .ScheduleOnce(TimeSpan delay, Action action, ICancelable cancelable);
  .ScheduleRepeatedly(TimeSpan initialDelay, TimeSpan interval, Action action);
  .ScheduleRepeatedly(TimeSpan initialDelay, TimeSpan interval, Action action, ICancelable cancelable);
```

There's also a set of extension methods for specifying delays and intervals in milliseconds as well as methods for all four variants (`ScheduleTellOnceCancelable`, `ScheduleTellRepeatedlyCancelable`, `ScheduleOnceCancelable`, `ScheduleRepeatedlyCancelable`) that creates a cancelable, schedules, and returns the cancelable. 

**Akka.NET `Config` now loaded automatically from App.config and Web.config**
In previous versions Akka.NET users had to do the following to load Akka.NET HOCON configuration sections from App.config or Web.config:

```csharp
var section = (AkkaConfigurationSection)ConfigurationManager.GetSection("akka");
var config = section.AkkaConfig;
var actorSystem = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem", config);
```

As of Akka.NET v1.0 this is now done for you automatically:

```csharp
var actorSystem = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem"); //automatically loads App/Web.config, if any
```

**Dispatchers**
Akka.NET v1.0 introduces the `ForkJoinDispatcher` as well as general purpose dispatcher re-use.

**Using ForkJoinDispatcher**
ForkJoinDispatcher is special - it uses [`Helios.Concurrency.DedicatedThreadPool`](https://github.com/helios-io/DedicatedThreadPool) to create a dedicated set of threads for the exclusive use of the actors configured to use a particular `ForkJoinDispatcher` instance. All of the remoting actors depend on the `default-remote-dispatcher` for instance.

Here's how you can create your own ForkJoinDispatcher instances via Config:

```
myapp{
  my-forkjoin-dispatcher{
    type = ForkJoinDispatcher
    throughput = 100
    dedicated-thread-pool{ #settings for Helios.DedicatedThreadPool
      thread-count = 3 #number of threads
      #deadlock-timeout = 3s #optional timeout for deadlock detection
      threadtype = background #values can be "background" or "foreground"
    }
  }
}
}
```

You can then use this specific `ForkJoinDispatcher` instance by configuring specific actors to use it, whether it's via config or the fluent interface on `Props`:

**Config**
```
akka.actor.deploy{
     /myActor1{
       dispatcher = myapp.my-forkjoin-dispatcher
     }
}
```

**Props**
```csharp
var actor = Sys.ActorOf(Props.Create<Foo>().WithDispatcher("myapp.my-forkjoin-dispatcher"));
```

**FluentConfiguration [REMOVED]**
`FluentConfig` has been removed as we've decided to standardize on HOCON configuration, but if you still want to use the old FluentConfig bits you can find them here: https://github.com/rogeralsing/Akka.FluentConfig

**F# API**
The F# API has changed to reflect the other C# interface changes, as well as unique additions specific to F#.

In addition to updating the F# API, we've also fixed a long-standing bug with being able to serialize discriminated unions over the wire. This has been resolved.

**Interface Renames**
In order to comply with .NET naming conventions and standards, all of the following interfaces have been renamed with the `I{InterfaceName}` prefix.

The following interfaces have all been renamed to include the `I` prefix:

- [X] `Akka.Actor.ActorRefProvider, Akka` (Public)
- [X] `Akka.Actor.ActorRefScope, Akka` (Public)

- [X] `Akka.Remote.InboundMessageDispatcher, Akka.Remote`
- [X] `Akka.Remote.RemoteRef, Akka.Remote`
- [X] `Akka.Routing.ConsistentHashable, Akka` (Public)

**`ConsistentHashRouter` and `IConsistentHashable`**
Akka.NET v1.0 introduces the idea of virtual nodes to the `ConsistentHashRouter`, which are designed to provide more even distributions of hash ranges across a relatively small number of routees. You can take advantage of virtual nodes via configuration:

```xml
akka.actor.deployment {
	/router1 {
		router = consistent-hashing-pool
		nr-of-instances = 3
		virtual-nodes-factor = 17
	}
}
```

Or via code:

```csharp
var router4 = Sys.ActorOf(Props.Empty.WithRouter(
	new ConsistentHashingGroup(new[]{c},hashMapping: hashMapping)
	.WithVirtualNodesFactor(5)), 
	"router4");
```

**`ConsistentHashMapping` Delegate**
There are three ways to instruct a router to hash a message:
1. Wrap the message in a `ConsistentHashableEnvelope`;
2. Implement the `IConsistentHashable` interface on your message types; or
3. Or, write a `ConsistentHashMapper` delegate and pass it to a `ConsistentHashingGroup` or a `ConsistentHashingPool` programmatically at create time.

Here's an example, taken from the `ConsistentHashSpecs`:

```csharp
ConsistentHashMapping hashMapping = msg =>
{
    if (msg is Msg2)
    {
        var m2 = msg as Msg2;
        return m2.Key;
    }

    return null;
};
var router2 =
    Sys.ActorOf(new ConsistentHashingPool(1, null, null, null, hashMapping: hashMapping)
    .Props(Props.Create<Echo>()), "router2");
```

Alternatively, you don't have to pass the `ConsistentHashMapping` into the constructor - you can use the `WithHashMapping` fluent interface built on top of both `ConsistentHashingGroup` and `ConsistentHashingPool`:

```csharp
var router2 =
    Sys.ActorOf(new ConsistentHashingPool(1).WithHashMapping(hashMapping)
    .Props(Props.Create<Echo>()), "router2");
```

**`ConsistentHashable` renamed to `IConsistentHashable`**
Any objects you may have decorated with the `ConsistentHashable` interface to work with `ConsistentHashRouter` instances will need to implement `IConsistentHashable` going forward, as all interfaces have been renamed with the `I-` prefix per .NET naming conventions.

**Akka.DI.Unity NuGet Package**
Akka.NET now ships with dependency injection support for [Unity](http://unity.codeplex.com/).

You can install our Unity package via the following command in the NuGet package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package Akka.DI.Unity
```

#### 0.8.0 Feb 11 2015

__Dependency Injection support for Ninject, Castle Windsor, and AutoFac__. Thanks to some amazing effort from individual contributor (**[@jcwrequests](https://github.com/jcwrequests "@jcwrequests")**), Akka.NET now has direct dependency injection support for [Ninject](http://www.ninject.org/), [Castle Windsor](http://docs.castleproject.org/Default.aspx?Page=MainPage&NS=Windsor&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1), and [AutoFac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac).

Here's an example using Ninject, for instance:

    // Create and build your container 
    var container = new Ninject.StandardKernel(); 
	container.Bind().To(typeof(TypedWorker)); 
	container.Bind().To(typeof(WorkerService));
    
    // Create the ActorSystem and Dependency Resolver 
	var system = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem"); 
	var propsResolver = new NinjectDependencyResolver(container,system);

	//Create some actors who need Ninject
	var worker1 = system.ActorOf(propsResolver.Create<TypedWorker>(), "Worker1");
	var worker2 = system.ActorOf(propsResolver.Create<TypedWorker>(), "Worker2");

	//send them messages
	worker1.Tell("hi!");

You can install these DI plugins for Akka.NET via NuGet - here's how:

* **Ninject** - `install-package Akka.DI.Ninject`
* **Castle Windsor** - `install-package Akka.DI.CastleWindsor`
* **AutoFac** - `install-package Akka.DI.AutoFac`

**Read the [full Dependency Injection with Akka.NET documentation](http://getakka.net/wiki/Dependency%20injection "Dependency Injection with Akka.NET") here.**

__Persistent Actors with Akka.Persistence (Alpha)__. Core contributor **[@Horusiath](https://github.com/Horusiath)** ported the majority of Akka's Akka.Persistence and Akka.Persistence.TestKit modules. 

> Even in the core Akka project these modules are considered to be "experimental," but the goal is to provide actors with a way of automatically saving and recovering their internal state to a configurable durable store - such as a database or filesystem.

Akka.Persistence also introduces the notion of *reliable delivery* of messages, achieved through the `GuaranteedDeliveryActor`.

Akka.Persistence also ships with an FSharp API out of the box, so while this package is in beta you can start playing with it either F# or C# from day one.

If you want to play with Akka.Persistence, please install any one of the following packages:

* **Akka.Persistence** - `install-package Akka.Persistence -pre`
* **Akka.Persistence.FSharp** - `install-package Akka.Persistence.FSharp -pre`
* **Akka.Persistence.TestKit** - `install-package Akka.Persistence.TestKit -pre`

__Remote Deployment of Routers and Routees__. You can now remotely deploy routers and routees via configuration, like so:

**Deploying _routees_ remotely via `Config`**:

	actor.deployment {
	    /blub {
	      router = round-robin-pool
	      nr-of-instances = 2
	      target.nodes = [""akka.tcp://${sysName}@localhost:${port}""]
	    }
	}

	var router = masterActorSystem.ActorOf(new RoundRobinPool(2).Props(Props.Create<Echo>()), "blub");

When deploying a router via configuration, just specify the `target.nodes` property with a list of `Address` instances for each node you want to deploy your routees.

> NOTE: Remote deployment of routees only works for `Pool` routers.

**Deploying _routers_ remotely via `Config`**:

	actor.deployment {
	    /blub {
	      router = round-robin-pool
	      nr-of-instances = 2
	      remote = ""akka.tcp://${sysName}@localhost:${port}""
	    }
	}

	var router = masterActorSystem.ActorOf(Props.Create<Echo>().WithRouter(FromConfig.Instance), "blub");

Works just like remote deployment of actors.

If you want to deploy a router remotely via explicit configuration, you can do it in code like this via the `RemoteScope` and `RemoteRouterConfig`:

**Deploying _routees_ remotely via explicit configuration**:

    var intendedRemoteAddress = Address.Parse("akka.tcp://${sysName}@localhost:${port}"
    .Replace("${sysName}", sysName)
    .Replace("${port}", port.ToString()));
    
     var router = myActorSystem.ActorOf(new RoundRobinPool(2).Props(Props.Create<Echo>())
    .WithDeploy(new Deploy(
		new RemoteScope(intendedRemoteAddress.Copy()))), "myRemoteRouter");

**Deploying _routers_ remotely via explicit configuration**:

    var intendedRemoteAddress = Address.Parse("akka.tcp://${sysName}@localhost:${port}"
    .Replace("${sysName}", sysName)
    .Replace("${port}", port.ToString()));
    
     var router = myActorSystem.ActorOf(
		new RemoteRouterConfig(
		new RoundRobinPool(2), new[] { new Address("akka.tcp", sysName, "localhost", port) })
        .Props(Props.Create<Echo>()), "blub2");

**Improved Serialization and Remote Deployment Support**. All internals related to serialization and remote deployment have undergone vast improvements in order to support the other work that went into this release.

**Pluggable Actor Creation Pipeline**. We reworked the plumbing that's used to provide automatic `Stash` support and exposed it as a pluggable actor creation pipeline for local actors.

This release adds the `ActorProducerPipeline`, which is accessible from `ExtendedActorSystem` (to be able to configure by plugins) and allows you to inject custom hooks satisfying following interface:


    interface IActorProducerPlugin {
	    bool CanBeAppliedTo(ActorBase actor);
	    void AfterActorCreated(ActorBase actor, IActorContext context);
	    void BeforeActorTerminated(ActorBase actor, IActorContext context);
    }

- **CanBeAppliedTo** determines if plugin can be applied to specific actor instance.
- **AfterActorCreated** is applied to actor after it has been instantiated by an `ActorCell` and before `InitializableActor.Init` method will (optionally) be invoked.
- **BeforeActorTerminated** is applied before actor terminates and before `IDisposable.Dispose` method will be invoked (for disposable actors) - **auto handling disposable actors is second feature of this commit**.

For common use it's better to create custom classes inheriting from `ActorProducerPluginBase` and `ActorProducerPluginBase<TActor>` classes.

Pipeline itself provides following interface:

    class ActorProducerPipeline : IEnumerable<IActorProducerPlugin> {
	    int Count { get; } // current plugins count - 1 by default (ActorStashPlugin)
	    bool Register(IActorProducerPlugin plugin)
	    bool Unregister(IActorProducerPlugin plugin)
	    bool IsRegistered(IActorProducerPlugin plugin)
	    bool Insert(int index, IActorProducerPlugin plugin)
    }

- **Register** - registers a plugin if no other plugin of the same type has been registered already (plugins with generic types are counted separately). Returns true if plugin has been registered.
- **Insert** - same as register, but plugin will be placed in specific place inside the pipeline - useful if any plugins precedence is required.
- **Unregister** - unregisters specified plugin if it has been found. Returns true if plugin was found and unregistered.
- **IsRegistered** - checks if plugin has been already registered.

By default pipeline is filled with one already used plugin - `ActorStashPlugin`, which replaces stash initialization/unstashing mechanism used up to this moment.

**MultiNodeTestRunner and Akka.Remote.TestKit**. The MultiNodeTestRunner and the Multi Node TestKit (Akka.Remote.TestKit) underwent some drastic changes in this update. They're still not quite ready for public use yet, but if you want to see what the experience is like you can [clone the Akka.NET Github repository](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net) and run the following command:

````
C:\akkadotnet> .\build.cmd MultiNodeTests
````

This will automatically launch all `MultiNodeSpec` instances found inside `Akka.Cluster.Tests`. We'll need to make this more flexible to be able to run other assemblies that require multinode tests in the future.

These tests are not enabled by default in normal build runs, but they will at some point in the future.

Here's a sample of the output from the console, to give you a sense of what the reporting looks like:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326939/6075685/5f7c56b2-ad8c-11e4-9d93-8216a8cbabaf.png)

The MultiNodeTestRunner uses XUnit internally and will dynamically deploy as many processes are needed to satisfy any individual test. Has been tested with up to 6 processes.


#### 0.7.1 Dec 13 2014
__Brand New F# API__. The entire F# API has been updated to give it a more native F# feel while still holding true to the Erlang / Scala conventions used in actor systems. [Read more about the F# API changes](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/526).

__Multi-Node TestKit (Alpha)__. Not available yet as a NuGet package, but the first pass at the Akka.Remote.TestKit is now available from source, which allow you to test your actor systems running on multiple machines or processes.

A multi-node test looks like this

    public class InitialHeartbeatMultiNode1 : InitialHeartbeatSpec
    {
    }
    
    public class InitialHeartbeatMultiNode2 : InitialHeartbeatSpec
    {
    }
    
    public class InitialHeartbeatMultiNode3 : InitialHeartbeatSpec
    {
    }
    
    public abstract class InitialHeartbeatSpec : MultiNodeClusterSpec
The MultiNodeTestRunner looks at this, works out that it needs to create 3 processes to run 3 nodes for the test.
It executes NodeTestRunner in each process to do this passing parameters on the command line. [Read more about the multi-node testkit here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/497).

__Breaking Change to the internal api: The `Next` property on `IAtomicCounter<T>` has been changed into the function `Next()`__ This was done as it had side effects, i.e. the value was increased when the getter was called. This makes it very hard to debug as the debugger kept calling the property and causing the value to be increased.

__Akka.Serilog__ `SerilogLogMessageFormatter` has been moved to the namespace `Akka.Logger.Serilog` (it used to be in `Akka.Serilog.Event.Serilog`).
Update your `using` statements from `using Akka.Serilog.Event.Serilog;` to `using Akka.Logger.Serilog;`.

__Breaking Change to the internal api: Changed signatures in the abstract class `SupervisorStrategy`__. The following methods has new signatures: `HandleFailure`, `ProcessFailure`. If you've inherited from `SupervisorStrategy`, `OneForOneStrategy` or `AllForOneStrategy` and overridden the aforementioned methods you need to update their signatures.

__TestProbe can be implicitly casted to ActorRef__. New feature. Tests requiring the `ActorRef` of a `TestProbe` can now be simplified:
``` C#
var probe = CreateTestProbe();
var sut = ActorOf<GreeterActor>();
sut.Tell("Akka", probe); // previously probe.Ref was required
probe.ExpectMsg("Hi Akka!");
```

__Bugfix for ConsistentHashableEvenlope__. When using `ConsistentHashableEvenlope` in conjunction with `ConsistentHashRouter`s, `ConsistentHashableEvenlope` now correctly extracts its inner message instead of sending the entire `ConsistentHashableEvenlope` directly to the intended routee.

__Akka.Cluster group routers now work as expected__. New update of Akka.Cluster - group routers now work as expected on cluster deployments. Still working on pool routers. [Read more about Akka.Cluster routers here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/489).

#### 0.7.0 Oct 16 2014
Major new changes and additions in this release, including some breaking changes...

__Akka.Cluster__ Support (pre-release) - Akka.Cluster is now available on NuGet as a pre-release package (has a `-pre` suffix) and is available for testing. After installing the the Akka.Cluster module you can add take advantage of clustering via configuration, like so:

    akka {
        actor {
          provider = "Akka.Cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider, Akka.Cluster"
        }

        remote {
          log-remote-lifecycle-events = DEBUG
          helios.tcp {
        hostname = "127.0.0.1"
        port = 0
          }
        }

        cluster {
          seed-nodes = [
        "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2551",
        "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2552"]

          auto-down-unreachable-after = 10s
        }
      }


And then use cluster-enabled routing on individual, named routers:

    /myAppRouter {
     router = consistent-hashing-pool
      nr-of-instances = 100
      cluster {
        enabled = on
        max-nr-of-instances-per-node = 3
        allow-local-routees = off
        use-role = backend
      }
    }

For more information on how clustering works, please see https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/400

__Breaking Changes: Improved Stashing__ - The old `WithUnboundedStash` and `WithBoundedStash` interfaces have been slightly changed and the `CurrentStash` property has been renamed to `Stash`. Any old stashing code can be replaced with the following in order to continue working:

    public IStash CurrentStash { get { return Stash; } set { Stash=value; } }

The `Stash` field is now automatically populated with an appropriate stash during the actor creation process and there is no need to set this field at all yourself.

__Breaking Changes: Renamed Logger Namespaces__ - The namespaces, DLL names, and NuGet packages for all logger add-ons have been changed to `Akka.Loggers.Xyz`. Please install the latest NuGet package (and uninstall the old ones) and update your Akka HOCON configurations accordingly.

__Serilog Support__ - Akka.NET now has an official [Serilog](http://serilog.net/) logger that you can install via the `Akka.Logger.Serilog` package. You can register the serilog logger via your HOCON configuration like this:

     akka.loggers=["Akka.Logger.Serilog.SerilogLogger, Akka.Logger.Serilog"]

__New Feature: Priority Mailbox__ - The `PriorityMailbox` allows you to define the priority of messages handled by your actors, and this is done by creating your own subclass of either the `UnboundedPriorityMailbox` or `BoundedPriorityMailbox` class and implementing the `PriorityGenerator` method like so:

    public class ReplayMailbox : UnboundedPriorityMailbox
    {
        protected override int PriorityGenerator(object message)
        {
            if (message is HttpResponseMessage) return 1;
            if (!(message is LoggedHttpRequest)) return 2;
            return 3;
        }
    }

The smaller the return value from the `PriorityGenerator`, the higher the priority of the message. You can then configure your actors to use this mailbox via configuration, using a fully-qualified name:


    replay-mailbox {
     mailbox-type: "TrafficSimulator.PlaybackApp.Actors.ReplayMailbox,TrafficSimulator.PlaybackApp"
    }

And from this point onward, any actor can be configured to use this mailbox via `Props`:

    Context.ActorOf(Props.Create<ReplayActor>()
                        .WithRouter(new RoundRobinPool(3))
                        .WithMailbox("replay-mailbox"));

__New Feature: Test Your Akka.NET Apps Using Akka.TestKit__ - We've refactored the testing framework used for testing Akka.NET's internals into a test-framework-agnostic NuGet package you can use for unit and integration testing your own Akka.NET apps. Right now we're scarce on documentation so you'll want to take a look at the tests inside the Akka.NET source for reference.

Right now we have Akka.TestKit adapters for both MSTest and XUnit, which you can install to your own project via the following:

MSTest:

    install-package Akka.TestKit.VsTest

XUnit:

    install-package Akka.TestKit.Xunit

__New Feature: Logging to Standard Out is now done in color__ - This new feature can be disabled by setting `StandardOutLogger.UseColors = false;`.
Colors can be customized: `StandardOutLogger.DebugColor = ConsoleColor.Green;`.
If you need to print to stdout directly use `Akka.Util.StandardOutWriter.Write()` instead of `Console.WriteLine`, otherwise your messages might get printed in the wrong color.
