* [Akka.Serialization: `INoSerializationVerificationNeeded` does not handle `IWrappedMessage` correctly](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7010)

**Akka.Analyzers**

The core Akka NuGet package now references [Akka.Analyzers](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.analyzers), a new set of Roslyn Code Analysis and Code Fix Providers that we distribute via NuGet. You can [see the full set of supported Akka.Analyzers rules here](https://getakka.net/articles/debugging/akka-analyzers.html).

**Akka.Cluster.Sharding Changes**

In [#6863](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6863) we made some major changes to the Akka.Cluster.Sharding API aimed at helping improve Cluster.Sharding's performance _and_ ease of use. However, these changes _may require some effort on the part of the end user_ in order to take full advantage:

* [`ExtractEntityId`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ExtractEntityId.html) and [`ExtractShardId`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ExtractShardId.html) have been deprecated as they _fundamentally can't be extended and can't benefit from the performance improvements introduced into Akka.NET v1.5.15_. It is **imperative** that you migrate to using the [`HashCodeMessageExtractor`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.HashCodeMessageExtractor.html) instead.
* You no longer need to handle [`ShardRegion.StartEntity`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion.StartEntity.html) or [`ShardingEnvelope`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardingEnvelope.html) inside your `IMessageExtractor` implementations, and in fact [`AK2001`](https://getakka.net/articles/debugging/rules/AK2001.html) (part of Akka.Analyzers) will automatically detect this and remove those handlers for you. Akka.NET automatically handles these two message types internally now.

**ClusterClient Serialization Changes**

In [#7032](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7032) we solved a long-standing serialization problem with the [`ClusterClient`](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Tools.Client.ClusterClient.html) where  `Send`, `SendToAll`, and `Publish` were not handled by the correct internal serializer. This has been fixed by default in Akka.NET v1.5.15, but this can potentially cause wire compatibility problems during upgrades - therefore we have introduced a configuration setting to toggle this:

```hocon
# re-enable legacy serialization
akka.cluster.client.use-legacy-serialization = on
```

That setting is currently set to `on` by default, so v1.5.15 will still behave like previous versions of Akka.NET. However, if you have been affected by serialization issues with the `ClusterClient` (such as [#6803](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/6803)) you should toggle this setting to `off`.

See "[Akka.NET v1.5.15 Upgrade Advisories](https://getakka.net/community/whats-new/akkadotnet-v1.5-upgrade-advisories.html)" for full details on some of the things you might need to do while upgrading to this version of Akka.NET.

__Akka.TestKit.Xunit Changes__

Due to breaking API change in Xunit 2.5.0, updating to Akka.NET 1.5.9 might break your unit tests. Some of the breaking change that we've noticed are:

* `AkkaEqualException` constructor has been changed due to changes in Xunit API. If you're using this class, please use the `AkkaEqualException.ForMismatchedValues()` static method instead of using the constructor.
* Testing for exception types by calling async code inside a sync delegate will not unwrap the `AggregateException` thrown. Either use async all the way or manually unwrap the exception.
* Xunit `Asset.Equal()` does not automatically check for collection item equality anymore, that means doing `Assert.Equal()` between two dictionary or list would not work anymore.
* Some Xunit classes have been changed from public to private. If you're using these classes, you will need to refactor your code.
* __FsCheck.Xunit:__ Xunit Roslyn analyzer has become a bit too overzealous and insists that all unit test method can only return either void or Task and will raise a compilation error if you tried to return anything else. If you're using `FsCheck.Xunit`, you will need to use a pragma to disable this check: `#pragma warning disable xUnit1028`.

#### 1.5.7 May 17th 2023 ####

Akka.NET v1.5.7 is a significant release that introduces a [major new reliable message delivery feature to Akka.NET and Akka.Cluster.Sharding](https://getakka.net/articles/actors/reliable-delivery.html): `Akka.Delivery`.

**`Akka.Delivery`**

Akka.Delivery is a reliable delivery system that leverages built-in actors, serialization, and persistence to help guarantee that all messages sent from one producer to one consumer will be delivered, in-order, even across process restarts / actor restarts / network outages.

Akka.Delivery's functionality is divded across four libraries:

* Akka - defines the base definitions for all messages, the `ProducerController` type, and the `ConsumerController` type;
* Akka.Cluster - contains the serialization definitions for Akka.Delivery;
* Akka.Persistence - contains the `EventSourcedProducerQueue` implementation, an optional feature that can be used to make the `ProducerController`'s outbound delivery queue persisted to the Akka.Persistence Journal and SnapshotStore; and
* Akka.Cluster.Sharding - contains the definitions for the `ShardingProducerController` and `ShardingConsumerController`.

We've documented how these features work in the following two detailed articles official website:

* "[Reliable Message Delivery with Akka.Delivery](https://getakka.net/articles/actors/reliable-delivery.html)"
* "[Reliable Delivery over Akka.Cluster.Sharding](https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding-delivery.html)"

* [Persistence.Sql.Common: Add transaction isolation level to SQL queries](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6654)

**SQL Transaction Isolation Level Setting**

In 1.5.3, we're introducing fine-grained control over transaction isolation level inside the `Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common` common library. This setting will be propagated to the rest of the SQL persistence plugin ecosystem and the `Akka.Hosting` package in their next release version.

Four new HOCON settings are introduced:
* `akka.persistence.journal.{plugin-name}.read-isolation-level`
* `akka.persistence.journal.{plugin-name}.write-isolation-level`
* `akka.persistence.snapshot-store.{plugin-name}.read-isolation-level`
* `akka.persistence.snapshot-store.{plugin-name}.write-isolation-level`

you can go to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.isolationlevel?#fields) to read more about these isolation level settings.

#### 1.5.0-beta1 February 20th 2023 ####
Version 1.5.0-beta1 contains **breaking API changes** and new API changes for Akka.NET.

**Breaking Changes: Logging**

In [https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6408](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6408) the entire `ILoggingAdapter` interface was rewritten in order to improve extensibility and performance (logging is now 30-40% faster in all cases and allocates ~50% fewer objects for large format strings).

All of the changes made here are _source compatible_, but not _binary compatible_ - meaning that users and package authors will need to do the following:

* Add `using Akka.Event` in all files that used the `ILoggingAdapter` and
* Recompile.

> NOTE: you can use a [`global using Akka.Event` directive](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/#global-using-directives) to do this solution / project-wide if your project supports C# 10 and / or .NET 6.

In addition to improving the performance of the `ILoggingAdapter` system, we've also made it more extensible - for instance, you can now globally configure the `ILogMessageFormatter` via the following HOCON:

```
akka { 
    loglevel=INFO,
    loggers=["Akka.Logger.Serilog.SerilogLogger, Akka.Logger.Serilog"]
    logger-formatter="Akka.Logger.Serilog.SerilogLogMessageFormatter, Akka.Logger.Serilog"
}
```

That will allow users to use the `SerilogLogMessageFormatter` globally throughout their applications - no more annoying calls like this inside individual actors that want to use semantic logging:

```csharp
private readonly ILoggingAdapter _logger = Context.GetLogger<SerilogLoggingAdapter>();
```

**Breaking Changes: Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common**

This is a breaking change that should effect almost no users, but [we deleted some old, bad ideas from the API surface](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6412) and it might require all Akka.Persistence.Sql* plugins to be recompiled.

For what it's worth, [Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common's performance has been improved significantly](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6384) and we'll continue working on that with some additional API changes this week.

**Other Changes and Additions**

#### 1.5.0-alpha3 November 15th 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha3 is a security patch for Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha2 but also includes some other fixes.

**Security Advisory**: Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha2 and earlier depend on an old System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager version 4.7.0 which transitively depends on System.Common.Drawing v4.7.0. The System.Common.Drawing v4.7.0 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability [GHSA-ghhp-997w-qr28](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghhp-997w-qr28).

We have separately created a security advisory for [Akka.NET Versions < 1.4.46 and < 1.5.0-alpha3 to track this issue](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/security/advisories/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8).

**Fixes and Updates**

* [Akka: Revert ConfigurationException due to binary incompatibility](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6204)

#### 1.5.0-alpha2 October 17th 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha2 is a maintenance release for Akka.NET v1.5 that contains numerous performance improvements in critical areas, including core actor message processing and Akka.Remote.

**Performance Fixes**

* [remove delegate allocation from `ForkJoinDispatcher` and `DedicatedThreadPool`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6162)
* [eliminate `Mailbox` delegate allocations](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6162)

* [removed boxing allocations inside `FSM.State.Equals`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6196)
* [Eliminate `DefaultLogMessageFormatter` allocations](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6166)

In sum you should expect to see total memory consumption, garbage collection, and throughput improve when you upgrade to Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha2.

**Other Features and Improvements**

* [DData: Suppress gossip message from showing up in debug log unless verbose debug logging is turned on](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6089)
* [TestKit: TestKit automatically injects the default TestKit default configuration if an ActorSystem is passed into its constructor](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6092)

* [Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common: Fix `DbCommand.CommandTimeout` in `BatchingSqlJournal`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6175)


#### 1.5.0-alpha1 August 22 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha1 is a major release that contains a lot of code improvement and rewrites/refactors. **Major upgrades to Akka.Cluster.Sharding in particular**.

__Deprecation__

Some codes and packages are being deprecated in v1.5
* [Deprecated/removed Akka.DI package](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6003)
  Please use the new `Akka.DependencyInjection` NuGet package as a replacement. Documentation can be read [here](https://getakka.net/articles/actors/dependency-injection.html)
* [Deprecated/removed Akka.MultiNodeTestRunner package](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6002)
  Please use the new `Akka.MultiNode.TestAdapter` NuGet package as a replacement. Documentation can be read [here](https://getakka.net/articles/testing/multi-node-testing.html).
* [Streams] [Refactor `SetHandler(Inlet, Outlet, IanAndOutGraphStageLogic)` to `SetHandlers()`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5931)

__Changes__

__Akka__

* [Add dual targetting to support .NET 6.0](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5926)
  All `Akka.NET` packages are now dual targetting netstandard2.0 and net6.0 platforms, we will be integrating .NET 6.0 better performing API and SDK in the future.
* [Add `IThreadPoolWorkItem` support to `ThreadPoolDispatcher`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5943)
* [Add `ValueTask` support to `PipeTo` extensions](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6025)
* [Add `CancellationToken` support to `Cancelable`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6032)
* [Fix long starting loggers crashing `ActorSystem` startup](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6053)
  All loggers are asynchronously started during `ActorSystem` startup. A warning will be logged if a logger does not respond within the prescribed `akka.logger-startup-timeout` period and will be awaited upon in a detached task until the `ActorSystem` is shut down. This have a side effect in that slow starting loggers might not be able to capture all log events emmited by the `EventBus` until it is ready.

__Akka.Cluster__

* [Fix `ChannelTaskScheduler` to work with Akka.Cluster, ported from 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5920)
* [Harden `Cluster.JoinAsync()` and `Cluster.JoinSeedNodesAsync()` methods](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6033)
* [Fix `ShardedDaemonProcess` should use lease, if configured](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6058)
* [Make `SplitBrainResolver` more tolerant to invalid node records](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6064)
* [Enable `Heartbeat` and `HearbeatRsp` message serialization and deserialization](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6063)
  By default, `Akka.Cluster` will now use the new `Heartbeat` and `HartbeatRsp` message serialization/deserialization that was introduced in version 1.4.19. If you're doing a rolling upgrade from a version older than 1.4.19, you will need to set `akka.cluster.use-legacy-heartbeat-message` to true.

__Akka.Cluster.Sharding__

* [Make Cluster.Sharding recovery more tolerant against corrupted persistence data](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5978)
* [Major reorganization to Akka.Cluster.Sharding](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5857)

The Akka.Cluster.Sharding changes in Akka.NET v1.5 are significant, but backwards compatible with v1.4 and upgrades should happen seamlessly.

Akka.Cluster.Sharding's `state-store-mode` has been split into two parts:

* CoordinatorStore
* ShardStore

Which can use different persistent mode configured via `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode` & `akka.cluster.sharding.remember-entities-store`.

Possible combinations:

state-store-mode | remember-entities-store | CoordinatorStore mode | ShardStore mode
------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------
persistence (default) | - (ignored) | persistence | persistence
ddata | ddata | ddata | ddata
ddata | eventsourced (new) | ddata | persistence

There should be no breaking changes from user perspective. Only some internal messages/objects were moved.
There should be no change in the `PersistentId` behavior and default persistent configuration (`akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode`)

This change is designed to speed up the performance of Akka.Cluster.Sharding coordinator recovery by moving `remember-entities` recovery into separate actors - this also solves major performance problems with the `ddata` recovery mode overall.

The recommended settings for maximum ease-of-use for Akka.Cluster.Sharding going forward will be:

```
akka.cluster.sharding{
  state-store-mode = ddata
  remember-entities-store = eventsourced
}
```

However, for the sake of backwards compatibility the Akka.Cluster.Sharding defaults have been left as-is:

```
akka.cluster.sharding{
  state-store-mode = persistence
  # remember-entities-store (not set - also uses legacy Akka.Persistence)
}
```

Switching over to using `remember-entities-store = eventsourced` will cause an initial migration of data from the `ShardCoordinator`'s journal into separate event journals going forward - __this migration is irreversible__ without taking the cluster offline and deleting all Akka.Cluster.Sharding-related data from Akka.Persistence, so plan accordingly.

__Akka.Cluster.Tools__

* [Add typed `ClusterSingleton` support](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6050)
* [Singleton can use `Member.AppVersion` metadata to decide its host node during hand-over](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6065)
  `Akka.Cluster.Singleton` can use `Member.AppVersion` metadata when it is relocating the singleton instance. When turned on, new singleton instance will be created on the oldest node in the cluster with the highest `AppVersion` number. You can opt-in to this behavior by setting `akka.cluster.singleton.consider-app-version` to true.

__Akka.Persistence.Query__

* [Add `TimeBasedUuid` offset property](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5995)

__Akka.Remote__

* [Fix typo in HOCON SSL settings. Backward compatible with the old setting names](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5895)
* [Treat all exceptions thrown inside `EndpointReader` message dispatch as transient, Ported from 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5972)
* [Fix SSL enable HOCON setting](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6038)

__Akka.Streams__

* [Allow GroupBy sub-flow to re-create closed sub-streams, backported to 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5874)
* [Fix ActorRef source not completing properly, backported to 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5875)
* [Rewrite `ActorRefSink` as a `GraphStage`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5920)
* [Add stream cancellation cause upstream propagation, ported from 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5949)
* [Fix `VirtualProcessor` subscription bug, ported from 1.4](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5950)
* [Refactor `Sink.Ignore` signature from `Task` to `Task<Done>`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5973)
* [Add `SourceWithContext.FromTuples()` operator`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5987)
* [Add `GroupedWeightedWithin` operator](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6000)
* [Add `IAsyncEnumerable` source](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/6044)

__Akka.TestKit__

* [Rewrite Akka.TestKit to work asynchronously from the ground up](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5953)

#### 1.4.32 January 19 2022 ####
Akka.NET v1.4.32 is a minor release that contains some API improvements. Most of the changes have been aimed at improving our web documentation and code cleanup to modernize some of our code. One big improvement in this version release is the Hyperion serialization update. 

Hyperion 0.12.0 introduces a new deserialization security mechanism to allow users to selectively filter allowed types during deserialization to prevent deserialization of untrusted data described [here](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html). This new feature is exposed in Akka.NET in HOCON through the new [`akka.actor.serialization-settings.hyperion.allowed-types`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/contrib/serializers/Akka.Serialization.Hyperion/reference.conf#L33-L35) settings or programmatically through the new `WithTypeFilter` method in the `HyperionSerializerSetup` class.

The simplest way to programmatically describe the type filter is to use the convenience class `TypeFilterBuilder`:

```c#
var typeFilter = TypeFilterBuilder.Create()
    .Include<AllowedClassA>()
    .Include<AllowedClassB>()
    .Build();
var setup = HyperionSerializerSetup.Default
    .WithTypeFilter(typeFilter);
```

You can also create your own implementation of `ITypeFilter` and pass an instance of it into the `WithTypeFilter` method.

For complete documentation, please read the Hyperion [readme on filtering types for secure deserialization.](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Hyperion#whitelisting-types-on-deserialization)

* [Akka.Streams: Added Flow.LazyInitAsync and Sink.LazyInitSink to replace Sink.LazyInit](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5476)
* [Akka.Serialization.Hyperion: Implement the new ITypeFilter security feature](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5510)

#### 1.4.31 December 20 2021 ####
Akka.NET v1.4.31 is a minor release that contains some bug fixes.

Akka.NET v1.4.30 contained a breaking change that broke binary compatibility with all Akka.DI plugins.
Even though those plugins are deprecated that change is not compatible with our SemVer standards 
and needed to be reverted. We regret the error.

#### 1.4.28 November 10 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.28 is a minor release that contains some enhancements for Akka.Streams and some bug fixes.

**New Akka.Streams Stages**
Akka.NET v1.4.28 includes two new Akka.Streams stages:

* [`Source.Never`](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/builtinstages.html#never) - a utility stage that never emits any elements, never completes, and never fails. Designed primarily for unit testing.
* [`Flow.WireTap`](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/builtinstages.html#wiretap) - the `WireTap` stage attaches a given `Sink` to a `Flow` without affecting any of the upstream or downstream elements. This stage is designed for performance monitoring and instrumentation of Akka.Streams graphs.

In addition to these, here are some other changes introduced Akka.NET v1.4.28:

* [Akka.Streams: `Source` that flattens a `Task` source and keeps the materialized value](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5338)
* [Akka.Streams: made `GraphStageLogic.LogSource` virtual and change default `StageLogic` `LogSource`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5360)
* [Akka.IO: `UdpListener` Responds IPv6 Bound message with IPv4 Bind message](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5344)
* [Akka.MultiNodeTestRunner: now runs on Linux and as a `dotnet test` package](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.MultiNodeTestRunner/releases/tag/1.0.0) - we will keep you posted on this, as we're still working on getting Rider / VS Code / Visual Studio debugger-attached support to work correctly.
* [Akka.Persistence.Sql.Common: Cancel `DBCommand` after finish reading events by PersistenceId ](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5311) - *massive* performance fix for Akka.Persistence with many log entries on SQL-based journals.
* [Akka.Actor: `DefaultResizer` does not reisize when `ReceiveAsync` is used](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5327)

#### 1.4.27 October 11 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.27 is a small release that contains some _major_ performance improvements for Akka.Remote.

**Performance Fixes**
In [RemoteActorRefProvider address paring, caching and resolving improvements](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5273) Akka.NET contributor @Zetanova introduced some major changes that make the entire `ActorPath` class much more reusable and more parse-efficient.

Our last major round of Akka.NET performance improvements in Akka.NET v1.4.25 produced the following:

```
OSVersion:                         Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0
ProcessorCount:                    16
ClockSpeed:                        0 MHZ
Actor Count:                       32
Messages sent/received per client: 200000  (2e5)
Is Server GC:                      True
Thread count:                      111

Num clients, Total [msg], Msgs/sec, Total [ms]
         1,  200000,    130634,    1531.54
         5, 1000000,    246975,    4049.20
        10, 2000000,    244499,    8180.16
        15, 3000000,    244978,   12246.39
        20, 4000000,    245159,   16316.37
        25, 5000000,    243333,   20548.09
        30, 6000000,    241644,   24830.55
```

In Akka.NET v1.4.27 those numbers now look like:

```
OSVersion:                         Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.
ProcessorCount:                    16                            
ClockSpeed:                        0 MHZ                         
Actor Count:                       32                            
Messages sent/received per client: 200000  (2e5)                 
Is Server GC:                      True                          
Thread count:                      111                           
                                                                 
Num clients, Total [msg], Msgs/sec, Total [ms]                   
         1,  200000,    105043,    1904.29                       
         5, 1000000,    255494,    3914.73                       
        10, 2000000,    291843,    6853.30                       
        15, 3000000,    291291,   10299.75                       
        20, 4000000,    286513,   13961.68                       
        25, 5000000,    292569,   17090.64                       
        30, 6000000,    281492,   21315.35
```

To put these numbers in comparison, here's what Akka.NET's performance looked like as of v1.4.0:

```
Num clients (actors)    Total [msg] Msgs/sec    Total [ms]
1   200000  69736   2868.60
5   1000000 141243  7080.98
10  2000000 136771  14623.27
15  3000000 38190   78556.49
20  4000000 32401   123454.60
25  5000000 33341   149967.08
30  6000000 126093  47584.92
```


We've made Akka.Remote consistently faster, more predictable, and reduced total memory consumption significantly in the process.

#### 1.4.26 September 28 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.26 is a very small release that addresses one wire format regression introduced in Akka.NET v1.4.20.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**
* [Akka.Remote / Akka.Persistence: PrimitiveSerializers manifest backwards compatibility problem](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5279) - this could cause regressions when upgrading to Akka.NET v1.4.20 and later. We have resolved this issue in Akka.NET v1.4.26. [Please see our Akka.NET v1.4.26 upgrade advisory for details](https://getakka.net/community/whats-new/akkadotnet-v1.4-upgrade-advisories.html#upgrading-to-akkanet-v1426-from-older-versions).
* [Akka.DistributedData.LightningDb: Revert #5180, switching back to original LightningDB packages](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5286)

#### 1.4.25 September 08 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**
Akka.NET v1.4.25 includes some _significant_ performance improvements for Akka.Remote and a number of important bug fixes and improvements.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**
* [Akka.IO.Tcp: connecting to an unreachable DnsEndpoint never times out](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5154)
* [Akka.Actor: need to enforce `stdout-loglevel = off` all the way through ActorSystem lifecycle](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5246)
* [Akka.Actor: `Ask` should push unhandled answers into deadletter](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5259)
* [Akka.Routing: Make Router.Route` virtual](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5238)
* [Akka.Actor: Improve performance on `IActorRef.Child` API](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5242) - _signficantly_ improves performance of many Akka.NET functions, but includes a public API change on `IActorRef` that is source compatible but not necessarily binary-compatible. `IActorRef GetChild(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<string> name)` is now `IActorRef GetChild(System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<string> name)`. This API is almost never called directly by user code (it's almost always called via the internals of the `ActorSystem` when resolving `ActorSelection`s or remote messages) so this change should be safe.
* [Akka.Actor: `IsNobody` throws NRE](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5213)
* [Akka.Cluster.Tools: singleton fix cleanup of overdue _removed members](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5229)
* [Akka.DistributedData: ddata exclude `Exiting` members in Read/Write `MajorityPlus`](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/5227)

**Performance Improvements**
Using our standard `RemotePingPong` benchmark, the difference between v1.4.24 and v1.4.24 is significant:

        30, 6000000,    241644,   24830.55
```

This represents a 24% overall throughput improvement in Akka.Remote across the board. We have additional PRs staged that should get aggregate performance improvements above 40% for Akka.Remote over v1.4.24 but they didn't make it into the Akka.NET v1.4.25 release.

#### 1.4.23 August 09 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**

Akka.NET v1.4.23 is designed to patch an issue that occurs on Linux machines using Akka.Cluster.Sharding with `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode=ddata` and `akka.cluster.sharding.remember-entities=on`: "[System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'lmdb' or one of its dependencies](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/5174)"

In [Akka.NET v1.4.21 we added built-in support for Akka.DistributedData.LightningDb](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/1.4.21) for use with the `remember-entities` setting, but we never received any reports about this issue until shortly after v1.4.22 was released. Fundamentally, the problem was that our downstream dependency, Lightning.NET, doesn't include any of the necessary Linux native binaries in their distributions currently. So in the meantime, we've published our own "vendored" distribution of Lightning.NET to NuGet until a new official one is released that includes these binaries.

There are some other small [fixes included in Akka.NET v1.4.23 and you can read about them here](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/milestone/54).

#### 1.4.22 August 05 2021 ####
**Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.4**

Akka.NET v1.4.22 is a fairly large release that includes an assortment of performance and bug fixes.

**Performance Fixes**
Akka.NET v1.4.22 includes a _significant_ performance improvement for `Ask<T>`, which now requires 1 internal `await` operation instead of 3:

**Akka.Cluster.Sharding.RepairTool**
In addition to the work done on Akka.NET itself, we've also created a separate tool for cleaning up any left-over data in the event of an Akka.Cluster.Sharding cluster running with `akka.cluster.sharding.state-store-mode=persistence` was terminated abruptly before it had a chance to cleanup.

We've added documentation to the Akka.NET website that explains how to use this tool here: https://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html#cleaning-up-akkapersistence-shard-state

And the tool itself has documentation here: https://github.com/petabridge/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.RepairTool
