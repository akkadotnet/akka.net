    /// INTERNAL API
    ///
    /// From an external viewpoint, the GraphInterpreter takes an assembly of graph processing stages encoded as a
    /// <see cref="Assembly"/> object and provides facilities to execute and interact with this assembly.
    /// <para/> The lifecycle of the Interpreter is roughly the following:
    /// <para/> - Boundary logics are attached via <see cref="AttachDownstreamBoundary"/> and <see cref="AttachUpstreamBoundary"/>
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Init"/> is called
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Execute"/> is called whenever there is need for execution, providing an upper limit on the processed events
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Finish"/> is called before the interpreter is disposed, preferably after <see cref="IsCompleted"/> returned true, although
    ///    in abort cases this is not strictly necessary
    ///
    /// The <see cref="Execute"/> method of the interpreter accepts an upper bound on the events it will process. After this limit
    /// is reached or there are no more pending events to be processed, the call returns. It is possible to inspect
    /// if there are unprocessed events left via the <see cref="IsSuspended"/> method. <see cref="IsCompleted"/> returns true once all stages
    /// reported completion inside the interpreter.
    ///
    /// The internal architecture of the interpreter is based on the usage of arrays and optimized for reducing allocations
    /// on the hot paths.
    ///
    /// One of the basic abstractions inside the interpreter is the notion of connection. In the abstract sense a
    /// connection represents an output-input port pair (an analogue for a connected RS Publisher-Subscriber pair),
    /// while in the practical sense a connection is a number which represents slots in certain arrays.
    /// <para/> In particular
    /// <para/> - portStates contains a bitfield that tracks the states of the ports (output-input) corresponding to this
    ///    connection. This bitfield is used to decode the event that is in-flight.
    /// <para/> - connectionSlots is a mapping from a connection id to a potential element or exception that accompanies the
    ///    event encoded in the portStates bitfield
    /// <para/> - inHandlers is a mapping from a connection id to the <see cref="InHandlers"/> instance that handles the events corresponding
    ///    to the input port of the connection
    /// <para/> - outHandlers is a mapping from a connection id to the <see cref="OutHandlers"/> instance that handles the events corresponding
    ///    to the output port of the connection
    ///
    /// On top of these lookup tables there is an eventQueue, represented as a circular buffer of integers. The integers
    /// it contains represents connections that have pending events to be processed. The pending event itself is encoded
    /// in the portStates bitfield. This implies that there can be only one event in flight for a given connection, which
    /// is true in almost all cases, except a complete-after-push or fail-after-push.
    ///
    /// The layout of the portStates bitfield is the following:
    ///
    ///             |- state machn.-| Only one bit is hot among these bits
    ///  64  32  16 | 8   4   2   1 |
    /// +---+---+---|---+---+---+---|
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  From the following flags only one is active in any given time. These bits encode
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  state machine states, and they are "moved" around using XOR masks to keep other bits
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  intact.
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   +- InReady:  The input port is ready to be pulled
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   +----- Pulling:  A pull is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
    ///   |   |   |   |   +--------- Pushing:  A push is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
    ///   |   |   |   +------------- OutReady: The output port is ready to be pushed
    ///   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   +----------------- InClosed:  The input port is closed and will not receive any events.
    ///   |   |                                 A push might be still in flight which will be then processed first.
    ///   |   +--------------------- OutClosed: The output port is closed and will not receive any events.
    ///   +------------------------- InFailed:  Always set in conjunction with InClosed. Indicates that the close event
    ///                                         is a failure
    ///
    /// Sending an event is usually the following sequence:
    ///  - An action is requested by a stage logic (push, pull, complete, etc.)
    ///  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned from a ready state to a pending event
    ///  - the id of the affected connection is enqueued
    ///
    /// Receiving an event is usually the following sequence:
    ///  - id of connection to be processed is dequeued
    ///  - the type of the event is determined from the bits set on portStates
    ///  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned to a ready state
    ///  - using the inHandlers/outHandlers table the corresponding callback is called on the stage logic.
    ///
    /// Because of the FIFO construction of the queue the interpreter is fair, i.e. a pending event is always executed
    /// after a bounded number of other events. This property, together with suspendability means that even infinite cycles can
    /// be modeled, or even dissolved (if preempted and a "stealing" external event is injected; for example the non-cycle
    /// edge of a balance is pulled, dissolving the original cycle).
