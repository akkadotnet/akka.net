    /// From an external viewpoint, the GraphInterpreter takes an assembly of graph processing stages encoded as a
    /// <see cref="Assembly"/> object and provides facilities to execute and interact with this assembly.
    /// <para/> The lifecycle of the Interpreter is roughly the following:
    /// <para/> - Boundary logics are attached via <see cref="AttachDownstreamBoundary(Connection,DownstreamBoundaryStageLogic)"/> and <see cref="AttachUpstreamBoundary(Connection,UpstreamBoundaryStageLogic)"/>
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Init"/> is called
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Execute"/> is called whenever there is need for execution, providing an upper limit on the processed events
    /// <para/> - <see cref="Finish"/> is called before the interpreter is disposed, preferably after <see cref="IsCompleted"/> returned true, although
    ///    in abort cases this is not strictly necessary
    ///
    /// The <see cref="Execute"/> method of the interpreter accepts an upper bound on the events it will process. After this limit
    /// is reached or there are no more pending events to be processed, the call returns. It is possible to inspect
    /// if there are unprocessed events left via the <see cref="IsSuspended"/> method. <see cref="IsCompleted"/> returns true once all stages
    /// reported completion inside the interpreter.
    ///
    /// The internal architecture of the interpreter is based on the usage of arrays and optimized for reducing allocations
    /// on the hot paths.
    ///
    /// One of the basic abstractions inside the interpreter is the <see cref="Connection"/>. A connection represents an output-input port pair
    /// (an analogue for a connected RS Publisher-Subscriber pair). The Connection object contains all the necessary data for the interpreter 
    /// to pass elements, demand, completion or errors across the Connection.
    /// <para/> In particular
    /// <para/> - portStates contains a bitfield that tracks the states of the ports (output-input) corresponding to this
    ///    connection. This bitfield is used to decode the event that is in-flight.
    /// <para/> - connectionSlot contains a potential element or exception that accompanies the
    ///    event encoded in the portStates bitfield
    /// <para/> - inHandler contains the <see cref="InHandler"/> instance that handles the events corresponding
    ///    to the input port of the connection
    /// <para/> - outHandler contains the <see cref="OutHandler"/> instance that handles the events corresponding
    ///    to the output port of the connection
    ///
    /// On top of the Connection table there is an eventQueue, represented as a circular buffer of Connections. The queue
    /// contains the Connections that have pending events to be processed. The pending event itself is encoded
    /// in the portState bitfield of the Connection. This implies that there can be only one event in flight for a given
    /// Connection, which is true in almost all cases, except a complete-after-push or fail-after-push which has to
    /// be decoded accordingly.
    ///
    /// The layout of the portState  bitfield is the following:
    ///
    ///             |- state machn.-| Only one bit is hot among these bits
    ///  64  32  16 | 8   4   2   1 |
    /// +---+---+---|---+---+---+---|
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  From the following flags only one is active in any given time. These bits encode
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  state machine states, and they are "moved" around using XOR masks to keep other bits
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  intact.
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   |   +- InReady:  The input port is ready to be pulled
    ///   |   |   |   |   |   +----- Pulling:  A pull is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
    ///   |   |   |   |   +--------- Pushing:  A push is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
    ///   |   |   |   +------------- OutReady: The output port is ready to be pushed
    ///   |   |   |
    ///   |   |   +----------------- InClosed:  The input port is closed and will not receive any events.
    ///   |   |                                 A push might be still in flight which will be then processed first.
    ///   |   +--------------------- OutClosed: The output port is closed and will not receive any events.
    ///   +------------------------- InFailed:  Always set in conjunction with InClosed. Indicates that the close event
    ///                                         is a failure
    ///
    /// Sending an event is usually the following sequence:
    ///  - An action is requested by a stage logic (push, pull, complete, etc.)
    ///  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned from a ready state to a pending event
    ///  - the affected Connection is enqueued
    ///
    /// Receiving an event is usually the following sequence:
    ///  - the connection to be processed is dequeued
    ///  - the type of the event is determined from the bits set on portStates
    ///  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned to a ready state
    ///  - using the inHandlers/outHandlers table the corresponding callback is called on the stage logic.
    ///
    /// Because of the FIFO construction of the queue the interpreter is fair, i.e. a pending event is always executed
    /// after a bounded number of other events. This property, together with suspendability means that even infinite cycles can
    /// be modeled, or even dissolved (if preempted and a "stealing" external event is injected; for example the non-cycle
    /// edge of a balance is pulled, dissolving the original cycle).

                      * Pull is very likely immediately followed by another Push/Pull. The difference from the "normal" event
                      * dispatch is that chased events are never touching the event queue, they use a "streamlined" execution path
                      * instead. Looking at the scenario of a Push, the following events will happen.
                      *  - "normal" dispatch executes an onPush event
                      *  - stage eventually calls push()
                      *  - code inside the push() method checks the validity of the call, and also if it can be safely ignored
                      *    (because the target stage already completed we just have not been notified yet)
                      *  - if the upper limit of ChaseLimit has not been reached, then the Connection is put into the chasedPush
                      *    variable
                      *  - the loop below immediately captures this push and dispatches it
                      *
                      * What is saved by this optimization is three steps:
                      *  - no need to enqueue the Connection in the queue (array), it ends up in a simple variable, reducing
                      *    pressure on array load-store
                      *  - no need to dequeue the Connection from the queue, similar to above
                      *  - no need to decode the event, we know it is a Push already
                      *  - no need to check for validity of the event because we already checked at the push() call, and there
                      *    can be no concurrent events interleaved unlike with the normal dispatch (think about a cancel() that is
                      *    called in the target stage just before the onPush() arrives). This avoids unnecessary branching.
