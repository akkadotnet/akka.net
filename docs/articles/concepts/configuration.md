# Akka.NET Configuration

*Quoted from [Akka.NET Bootcamp: Unit 2, Lesson 1 - "Using HOCON Configuration to Configure Akka.NET"](https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp/tree/master/src/Unit-2/lesson1 "Using HOCON Configuration to Configure Akka.NET")*

Akka.NET leverages a configuration format, called HOCON, to allow you to configure your Akka.NET applications with whatever level of granularity you want.

#### What is HOCON?
HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation) is a flexible and extensible configuration format. It will allow you to configure everything from Akka.NET's `IActorRefProvider` implementation, logging, network transports, and more commonly - how individual actors are deployed.

Values returned by HOCON are strongly typed (i.e. you can fetch out an `int`, a `Timespan`, etc).

#### What can I do with HOCON?
HOCON allows you to embed easily-readable configuration inside of the otherwise hard-to-read XML in App.config and Web.config.  HOCON also lets you query configs by their section paths, and those sections are exposed strongly typed and parsed values you can use inside your applications.

HOCON also lets you nest and/or chain sections of configuration, creating layers of granularity and providing you a semantically namespaced config.

#### What is HOCON usually used for?
HOCON is commonly used for tuning logging settings, enabling special modules (such as `Akka.Remote`), or configuring deployments such as the `Dispatcher` or `Router` used for a particular actor.

For example, let's configure an `ActorSystem` with HOCON:

```csharp
var config = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString(@"
akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp {
    transport-class = ""Akka.Remote.Transport.DotNetty.DotNettyTransport, Akka.Remote""
    transport-protocol = tcp
    port = 8091
    hostname = ""127.0.0.1""
}");

var system = ActorSystem.Create("MyActorSystem", config);
```

As you can see in that example, a HOCON `Config` object can be parsed from a `string` using the `ConfigurationFactory.ParseString` method. Once you have a `Config` object, you can then pass this to your `ActorSystem` inside the `ActorSystem.Create` method.

#### "Deployment"? What's that?
Deployment is a vague concept, but it's closely tied to HOCON. An actor is "deployed" when it is instantiated and put into service within the `ActorSystem` somewhere.

When an actor is instantiated within the `ActorSystem` it can be deployed in one of two places: inside the local process or in another process (this is what `Akka.Remote` does.)

When an actor is deployed by the `ActorSystem`, it has a range of configuration settings. These settings control a wide range of behavior options for the actor, such as: is this actor going to be a router? What `Dispatcher` will it use? What type of mailbox will it have? (More on these concepts in later lessons.)

We haven't gone over what all these options mean, but *the key thing to know for now is that the settings used by the `ActorSystem` to deploy an actor into service can be set within HOCON. *

***This also means that you can change the behavior of actors dramatically (by changing these settings) without having to actually touch the actor code itself.***

Flexible config FTW!

#### HOCON can be used inside `App.config` and `Web.config`
Parsing HOCON from a `string` is handy for small configuration sections, but what if you want to be able to take advantage of [Configuration Transforms for `App.config` and `Web.config`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd465326.aspx) and all of the other nice tools we have in the `System.Configuration` namespace?

As it turns out, you can use HOCON inside these configuration files too!

Here's an example of using HOCON inside `App.config`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="akka" type="Akka.Configuration.Hocon.AkkaConfigurationSection, Akka" />
  </configSections>

  <akka>
    <hocon>
      <![CDATA[
          akka {
            # here we are configuring log levels
            log-config-on-start = off
            stdout-loglevel = INFO
            loglevel = ERROR
            # this config section will be referenced as akka.actor
            actor {
              provider = remote
              debug {
                  receive = on
                  autoreceive = on
                  lifecycle = on
                  event-stream = on
                  unhandled = on
              }
            }
            # here we're configuring the Akka.Remote module
            remote {
              dot-netty.tcp {
                  transport-class = "Akka.Remote.Transport.DotNetty.DotNettyTransport, Akka.Remote"
                  #applied-adapters = []
                  transport-protocol = tcp
                  port = 8091
                  hostname = "127.0.0.1"
              }
            log-remote-lifecycle-events = INFO
          }
      ]]>
    </hocon>
  </akka>
</configuration>
```

And then we can load this configuration section into our `ActorSystem` via the following code:

```csharp
var system = ActorSystem.Create("MySystem"); //automatically loads App/Web.config
```

#### HOCON Configuration Supports Fallbacks
Although this isn't a concept we leverage explicitly in Unit 2, it's a powerful trait of the `Config` class that comes in handy in lots of production use cases.

HOCON supports the concept of "fallback" configurations - it's easiest to explain this concept visually.

![Normal HOCON Config Behavior](/images/hocon-config-normally.gif)

To create something that looks like the diagram above, we have to create a `Config` object that has three fallbacks chained behind it using syntax like this:

```csharp
var f0 = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString("a = bar");
var f1 = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString("b = biz");
var f2 = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString("c = baz");
var f3 = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString("a = foo");

var yourConfig = f0.WithFallback(f1)
				   .WithFallback(f2)
				   .WithFallback(f3);
```

If we request a value for a HOCON object with key "a", using the following code:

```csharp
var a = yourConfig.GetString("a");
```

Then the internal HOCON engine will match the first HOCON file that contains a definition for key `a`. In this case, that is `f0`, which returns the value "bar".

####  Why wasn't "foo" returned as the value for "a"?
The reason is because HOCON only searches through fallback `Config` objects if a match is NOT found earlier in the `Config` chain. If the top-level `Config` object has a match for `a`, then the fallbacks won't be searched. In this case, a match for `a` was found in `f0` so the `a=foo` in `f3` was never reached.

#### What happens when there is a HOCON key miss?
What happens if we run the following code, given that `c` isn't defined in `f0` or `f1`?

```csharp
var c = yourConfig.GetString("c");
```

![Fallback HOCON Config Behavior](/images/hocon-config-fallbacks.gif)

In this case `yourConfig` will fallback twice to `f2` and return "baz" as the value for key `c`.
