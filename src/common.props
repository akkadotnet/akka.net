    <PackageReleaseNotes>Maintenance Release for Akka.NET 1.3**
Akka.NET v1.3.9 features some major changes to Akka.Cluster.Sharding, additional Akka.Streams stages, and some general bug fixes across the board.
Akka.Cluster.Sharding Improvements**
The [Akka.Cluster.Sharding documentation](http://getakka.net/articles/clustering/cluster-sharding.html#quickstart) already describes some of the major changes in Akka.NET v1.3.9, but we figured it would be worth calling special attention to those changes here.
Props Factory for Entity Actors**
&gt; In some cases, the actor may need to know the `entityId` associated with it. This can be achieved using the `entityPropsFactory` parameter to `ClusterSharding.Start` or `ClusterSharding.StartAsync`. The entity ID will be passed to the factory as a parameter, which can then be used in the creation of the actor.
In addition to the existing APIs we've always had for defining sharded entities via `Props`, Akka.NET v1.3.9 introduces [a new method overload for `Start`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_Start_System_String_System_Func_System_String_Akka_Actor_Props__Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterShardingSettings_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractEntityId_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractShardId_) and [`StartAsync`](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_StartAsync_System_String_System_Func_System_String_Akka_Actor_Props__Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterShardingSettings_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractEntityId_Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ExtractShardId_) which allows users to pass in the `entityId` of each entity actor as a constructor argument to those entities when they start.
For example:
```
var anotherCounterShard = ClusterSharding.Get(Sys).Start(
	                        typeName: "AnotherCounter",
	                        entityProps: Props.Create&lt;AnotherCounter&gt;(),
	                        typeName: AnotherCounter.ShardingTypeName,
	                        entityPropsFactory: entityId =&gt; AnotherCounter.Props(entityId),
	                        settings: ClusterShardingSettings.Create(Sys),
	                        extractEntityId: Counter.ExtractEntityId,
	                        extractShardId: Counter.ExtractShardId);
```
This will give you the opportunity to pass in the `entityId` for each actor as a constructor argument into the `Props` of your entity actor and possibly other use cases too.
Improvements to Starting and Querying Existing Shard Entity Types**
Two additional major usability improvements to Cluster.Sharding come from some API additions and changes.
The first is that it's now possible to look up all of the currently registered shard types via the [`ClusterSharding.ShardTypeNames` property](http://getakka.net/api/Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.html#Akka_Cluster_Sharding_ClusterSharding_ShardTypeNames). So long as a `ShardRegion` of that type has been started in the cluster, that entity type name will be added to the collection exposed by this property.
The other major usability improvement is a change to the `ClusterSharding.Start` property itself. Historically, you used to have to know whether or not the node you wanted to use sharding on was going to be hosting shards (call `ClusterSharding.Start`) or simply communicated with shards hosted on a different cluster role type (call `ClusterSharding.StartProxy`). Going forward, it's safe to call `ClusterSharding.Start` on any node and you will either receive an `IActorRef` to active `ShardRegion` or a `ShardRegion` running in "proxy only" mode; this is determined by looking at the `ClusterShardingSettings` and determining if the current node is in a role that is allowed to host shards of this type.
