# Console Application

The console application gives immediate feedback on how a piece of software works. That how most developers test out, quickly, new products to understand its entry and exit point!

# ASP.NET Core

By using Akka.NET in your ASP.NET Core project, you can make your `Controllers` lightweight while Akka.NET handles the heavyweights.

# Headless Service

A “headless” service is one that doesn’t expose a public-facing API or UI of any kind - no HTTP APIs, no gRPC, etc. 
Headless services can still communicate with other services via private messaging systems such as Akka.Remote, Kafka, Apache Pulsar, RabbitMQ, and so forth - but they run in the background of most networked applications.
