    /**
    * This extension provides sharding functionality of actors in a cluster.
    * The typical use case is when you have many stateful actors that together consume
    * more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine. You need to distribute them across
    * several nodes in the cluster and you want to be able to interact with them using their
    * logical identifier, but without having to care about their physical location in the cluster,
    * which might also change over time. It could for example be actors representing Aggregate Roots in
    * Domain-Driven Design terminology. Here we call these actors "entries". These actors
    * typically have persistent (durable) state, but this feature is not limited to
    * actors with persistent state.
    *
    * In this context sharding means that actors with an identifier, so called entries,
    * can be automatically distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each entry
    * actor runs only at one place, and messages can be sent to the entry without requiring
    * the sender to know the location of the destination actor. This is achieved by sending
    * the messages via a [[ShardRegion]] actor provided by this extension, which knows how
    * to route the message with the entry id to the final destination.
    *
    * This extension is supposed to be used by first, typically at system startup on each node
    * in the cluster, registering the supported entry types with the [[ClusterSharding#start]]
    * method and then the `ShardRegion` actor for a named entry type can be retrieved with
    * [[ClusterSharding#shardRegion]]. Messages to the entries are always sent via the local
    * `ShardRegion`. Some settings can be configured as described in the `akka.contrib.cluster.sharding`
    * section of the `reference.conf`.
    *
    * The `ShardRegion` actor is started on each node in the cluster, or group of nodes
    * tagged with a specific role. The `ShardRegion` is created with two application specific
    * functions to extract the entry identifier and the shard identifier from incoming messages.
    * A shard is a group of entries that will be managed together. For the first message in a
    * specific shard the `ShardRegion` request the location of the shard from a central coordinator,
    * the [[ShardCoordinator]]. The `ShardCoordinator` decides which `ShardRegion` that
    * owns the shard. The `ShardRegion` receives the decided home of the shard
    * and if that is the `ShardRegion` instance itself it will create a local child
    * actor representing the entry and direct all messages for that entry to it.
    * If the shard home is another `ShardRegion` instance messages will be forwarded
    * to that `ShardRegion` instance instead. While resolving the location of a
    * shard incoming messages for that shard are buffered and later delivered when the
    * shard home is known. Subsequent messages to the resolved shard can be delivered
    * to the target destination immediately without involving the `ShardCoordinator`.
    *
    * To make sure that at most one instance of a specific entry actor is running somewhere
    * in the cluster it is important that all nodes have the same view of where the shards
    * are located. Therefore the shard allocation decisions are taken by the central
    * `ShardCoordinator`, which is running as a cluster singleton, i.e. one instance on
    * the oldest member among all cluster nodes or a group of nodes tagged with a specific
    * role. The oldest member can be determined by [[akka.cluster.Member#isOlderThan]].
    *
    * The logic that decides where a shard is to be located is defined in a pluggable shard
    * allocation strategy. The default implementation [[ShardCoordinator.LeastShardAllocationStrategy]]
    * allocates new shards to the `ShardRegion` with least number of previously allocated shards.
    * This strategy can be replaced by an application specific implementation.
    *
    * To be able to use newly added members in the cluster the coordinator facilitates rebalancing
    * of shards, i.e. migrate entries from one node to another. In the rebalance process the
    * coordinator first notifies all `ShardRegion` actors that a handoff for a shard has started.
    * That means they will start buffering incoming messages for that shard, in the same way as if the
    * shard location is unknown. During the rebalance process the coordinator will not answer any
    * requests for the location of shards that are being rebalanced, i.e. local buffering will
    * continue until the handoff is completed. The `ShardRegion` responsible for the rebalanced shard
    * will stop all entries in that shard by sending `PoisonPill` to them. When all entries have
    * been terminated the `ShardRegion` owning the entries will acknowledge the handoff as completed
    * to the coordinator. Thereafter the coordinator will reply to requests for the location of
    * the shard and thereby allocate a new home for the shard and then buffered messages in the
    * `ShardRegion` actors are delivered to the new location. This means that the state of the entries
    * are not transferred or migrated. If the state of the entries are of importance it should be
    * persistent (durable), e.g. with `akka-persistence`, so that it can be recovered at the new
    * location.
    *
    * The logic that decides which shards to rebalance is defined in a pluggable shard
    * allocation strategy. The default implementation [[ShardCoordinator.LeastShardAllocationStrategy]]
    * picks shards for handoff from the `ShardRegion` with most number of previously allocated shards.
    * They will then be allocated to the `ShardRegion` with least number of previously allocated shards,
    * i.e. new members in the cluster. There is a configurable threshold of how large the difference
    * must be to begin the rebalancing. This strategy can be replaced by an application specific
    * implementation.
    *
    * The state of shard locations in the `ShardCoordinator` is persistent (durable) with
    * `akka-persistence` to survive failures. Since it is running in a cluster `akka-persistence`
    * must be configured with a distributed journal. When a crashed or unreachable coordinator
    * node has been removed (via down) from the cluster a new `ShardCoordinator` singleton
    * actor will take over and the state is recovered. During such a failure period shards
    * with known location are still available, while messages for new (unknown) shards
    * are buffered until the new `ShardCoordinator` becomes available.
    *
    * As long as a sender uses the same `ShardRegion` actor to deliver messages to an entry
    * actor the order of the messages is preserved. As long as the buffer limit is not reached
    * messages are delivered on a best effort basis, with at-most once delivery semantics,
    * in the same way as ordinary message sending. Reliable end-to-end messaging, with
    * at-least-once semantics can be added by using `AtLeastOnceDelivery` in `akka-persistence`.
    *
    * Some additional latency is introduced for messages targeted to new or previously
    * unused shards due to the round-trip to the coordinator. Rebalancing of shards may
    * also add latency. This should be considered when designing the application specific
    * shard resolution, e.g. to avoid too fine grained shards.
    *
    * The `ShardRegion` actor can also be started in proxy only mode, i.e. it will not
    * host any entries itself, but knows how to delegate messages to the right location.
    * A `ShardRegion` starts in proxy only mode if the roles of the node does not include
    * the node role specified in `akka.contrib.cluster.sharding.role` config property
    * or if the specified `entryProps` is `None`/`null`.
    *
    * If the state of the entries are persistent you may stop entries that are not used to
    * reduce memory consumption. This is done by the application specific implementation of
    * the entry actors for example by defining receive timeout (`context.setReceiveTimeout`).
    * If a message is already enqueued to the entry when it stops itself the enqueued message
    * in the mailbox will be dropped. To support graceful passivation without loosing such
    * messages the entry actor can send [[ShardRegion.Passivate]] to its parent `ShardRegion`.
    * The specified wrapped message in `Passivate` will be sent back to the entry, which is
    * then supposed to stop itself. Incoming messages will be buffered by the `ShardRegion`
    * between reception of `Passivate` and termination of the entry. Such buffered messages
    * are thereafter delivered to a new incarnation of the entry.
