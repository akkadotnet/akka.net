# Akka.NET Users and Use Cases

Akka.NET is used by many large organizations and in industries such as investment and merchant banking, retail and social media, simulation, gaming and betting, automobile and traffic systems, health care, data analytics, and much more. 
Any system that has the need for high-throughput and low latency is a good candidate for using Akka.NET.

> Sam Covington, IVC Business Systems: We had an in-house "Actor" system that we replaced with Akka.Net, which allowed us to innovate and be productive elsewhere, and not reinvent the wheel(not to mention test it to death). This back end of Microservices forms the basis of all of our products and services. We're using it in our Enterprise Social Product, and our new Livescan Office product for Livescan fingerprinting customers.
